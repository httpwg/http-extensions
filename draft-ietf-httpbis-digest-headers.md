# Introduction

HTTP does not define the means to protect the data integrity of content or
representations. When HTTP messages are transferred between endpoints, lower layer
features or properties such as TCP checksums or TLS records {{?TLS=RFC8446}} can provide
some integrity protection. However, transport-oriented integrity provides a
limited utility because it is opaque to the application layer and only covers
the extent of a single connection. HTTP messages often travel over a chain of
separate connections, in between connections there is a possibility for
unintended or malicious data corruption. An HTTP integrity mechanism can provide
the means for endpoints, or applications using HTTP, to detect data corruption
and make a choice about how to act on it. An example use case is to aid
fault detection and diagnosis across system boundaries.

This document defines two digest integrity mechanisms for HTTP.
First, content integrity, which acts on conveyed content ({{Section 6.4 of
RFC9110}}).
Second, representation data integrity, which acts on representation data ({{Section 3.2
of RFC9110}}). This supports advanced use cases such as validating the
integrity of a resource that was reconstructed from parts retrieved using
multiple requests or connections.


This document obsoletes RFC 3230 and therefore the Digest and Want-Digest HTTP
fields; see {{obsolete-3230}}.


## Document Structure

This document is structured as follows:

- New request and response header and trailer field definitions.
  - {{content-digest}} (Content-Digest),
  - {{representation-digest}} (Repr-Digest), and
  - {{want-fields}} (Want-Content-Digest and Want-Repr-Digest).
- Considerations specific to representation data integrity.
  - {{state-changing-requests}} (State-changing requests),
  - {{digest-and-content-location}} (Content-Location),
  - {{resource-representation}} contains worked examples of Representation data
    in message exchanges, and
  - {{examples-unsolicited}} and {{examples-solicited}} contain worked examples
  of Repr-Digest and Want-Repr-Digest fields in message exchanges.
- {{algorithms}} presents hash algorithm considerations and defines
  registration procedures for future entries.

## Concept Overview

The HTTP fields defined in this document can be used for HTTP integrity. Senders
choose a hashing algorithm and calculate a digest from an input related to the
HTTP message, the algorithm identifier and digest are transmitted in an HTTP
field. Receivers can validate the digest for integrity purposes. Hashing
algorithms are registered in the "Hash Algorithms for HTTP Digest Fields" (see
{{algorithms}}).

Selecting the data on which digests are calculated depends on the use case of
HTTP messages. This document provides different fields for HTTP representation
data and HTTP content.

There are use-cases where a simple digest of the HTTP content bytes is
required. The `Content-Digest` request and response header and trailer field is
defined to support digests of content ({{Section 6.4 of RFC9110}}); see
{{content-digest}}.

For more advanced use-cases, the `Repr-Digest` request and response header
and trailer field ({{representation-digest}}) is defined. It contains a digest value
computed by applying a hashing algorithm to selected representation data
({{Section 3.2 of RFC9110}}). Basing `Repr-Digest` on the selected
representation makes it straightforward to apply it to use-cases where the
message content requires some sort of manipulation to be considered as
representation of the resource or content conveys a partial representation of a resource,
such as Range Requests (see {{Section 14 of RFC9110}}).

`Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest` support hashing algorithm agility.
The `Want-Content-Digest` and `Want-Repr-Digest` fields allow
endpoints to express interest in `Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest`
respectively, and to express algorithm preferences in either.

`Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest` are collectively termed
Integrity fields.
`Want-Content-Digest` and `Want-Repr-Digest` are
collectively termed Integrity preference fields.

Integrity fields are tied to the `Content-Encoding`
and `Content-Type` header fields. Therefore, a given resource may have multiple
different digest values when transferred with HTTP.

Integrity fields do not provide integrity for
HTTP messages or fields. However, they can be combined with other mechanisms that
protect metadata, such as digital signatures, in order to protect
the phases of an HTTP exchange in whole or in part. For example, HTTP Message
Signatures {{SIGNATURES}} could be used to sign Integrity fields, thus providing
coverage for HTTP content or representation data.

This specification does not define means for authentication, authorization or privacy.

## Obsoleting RFC 3230 {#obsolete-3230}

[RFC3230] defined the `Digest` and `Want-Digest` HTTP fields for HTTP integrity.
It also coined the term "instance" and "instance manipulation" in order to
explain concepts that are now more universally defined, and implemented, as HTTP
semantics such as selected representation data ({{Section 3.2 of RFC9110}}).

Experience has shown that implementations of [RFC3230] have interpreted the
meaning of "instance" inconsistently, leading to interoperability issues. The
most common issue relates to the mistake of calculating the digest using (what
we now call) message content, rather than using (what we now call)
representation data as was originally intended. Interestingly, time has also
shown that a digest of message content can be beneficial for some use cases. So
it is difficult to detect if non-conformance to [RFC3230] is intentional or
unintentional.

In order to address potential inconsistencies and ambiguity across
implementations of `Digest` and `Want-Digest`, this document obsoletes
[RFC3230]. The Integrity fields ({{representation-digest}} and
{{content-digest}}) and Integrity preference fields ({{want-fields}})
defined in this document are better aligned with current HTTP semantics and
have names that more clearly articulate the intended usages.


## Notational Conventions
{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated by
[RFC7405].

This document uses the following terminology from {{Section 3 of
!STRUCTURED-FIELDS=RFC8941}} to specify syntax and parsing:
Boolean, Byte Sequence, Dictionary, Integer, and List.

The definitions "representation", "selected representation", "representation
data", "representation metadata", "user agent" and "content" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC9110}}.

This document uses the line folding strategies
described in [FOLDING].

Hashing algorithm names respect the casing used in their definition document (e.g. SHA-1, CRC32c)
whereas hashing algorithm keys are quoted (e.g. "sha", "crc32c").

The term "checksum" describes the output of the application of an algorithm
to a sequence of bytes,
whereas "digest" is only used in relation to the value contained in the fields.

Integrity fields: collective term for `Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest`

Integrity preference fields: collective term for `Want-Repr-Digest` and `Want-Content-Digest`


# The Content-Digest Field {#content-digest}

The `Content-Digest` HTTP field can be used in requests and responses to
communicate digests that are calculated using a hashing algorithm applied to
the actual message content (see {{Section 6.4 of RFC9110}}). It is a
`Dictionary` (see {{Section 3.2 of STRUCTURED-FIELDS}})
where each:

* key conveys the hashing algorithm (see {{algorithms}})
  used to compute the digest;
* value is a `Byte Sequence` ({{Section 3.3.5 of STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}), that
  conveys an encoded version of the byte output produced by the digest
  calculation.

For example:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Content-Digest: \
  sha-512=:WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrI\
  iYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==:
~~~

The `Dictionary` type can be used, for example, to attach multiple digests
calculated using different hashing algorithms in order to support a population
of endpoints with different or evolving capabilities. Such an approach could
support transitions away from weaker algorithms (see {{sec-agility}}).

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Content-Digest: \
  sha-256=:4REjxQ4yrqUVicfSKYNO/cF9zNj5ANbzgDZt3/h3Qxo=:,\
  sha-512=:WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrI\
  iYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==:
~~~

A recipient MAY ignore any or all digests.
This allows the recipient to choose which hashing algorithm(s) to use for
validation instead of verifying every digest.

A sender MAY send a digest without
knowing whether the recipient supports a given hashing algorithm, or even knowing
that the recipient will ignore it.

`Content-Digest` can be sent in a trailer section.
In this case,
`Content-Digest` MAY be merged into the header section; see {{Section 6.5.1 of RFC9110}}.


# The Repr-Digest Field {#representation-digest}

The `Repr-Digest` HTTP field can be used in requests and responses to
communicate digests that are calculated using a hashing algorithm applied to
the entire selected representation data (see {{Section 8.1 of RFC9110}}).

Representations take into account the effect of the HTTP semantics on
messages. For example, the content can be affected by Range Requests or methods
such as HEAD, while the way the content is transferred "on the wire" is
dependent on other transformations (e.g. transfer codings for HTTP/1.1 - see
{{Section 6.1 of RFC9112}}). To help illustrate HTTP representation concepts,
several examples are provided in {{resource-representation}}.

When a message has no representation data it is still possible to assert that no
representation data was sent by computing the digest on an empty
string (see {{usage-in-signatures}}).

`Repr-Digest` is a `Dictionary` (see {{Section 3.2 of
STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}) where each:

* key conveys the hashing algorithm (see {{algorithms}})
  used to compute the digest;
* value is a `Byte Sequence`, that conveys an encoded version of the byte
  output produced by the digest calculation.

For example:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Repr-Digest: \
  sha-512=:WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrI\
  iYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==:
~~~

The `Dictionary` type can be used, for example, to attach multiple digests
calculated using different hashing algorithms in order to support a population
of endpoints with different or evolving capabilities. Such an approach could
support transitions away from weaker algorithms (see {{sec-agility}}).

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Repr-Digest: \
  sha-256=:4REjxQ4yrqUVicfSKYNO/cF9zNj5ANbzgDZt3/h3Qxo=:,\
  sha-512=:WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrI\
  iYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==:
~~~

A recipient MAY ignore any or all digests.
This allows the recipient to choose which hashing algorithm(s) to use for
validation instead of verifying every digest.

A sender MAY send a digest without knowing whether the
recipient supports a given hashing algorithm, or even knowing that the recipient
will ignore it.

`Repr-Digest` can be sent in a trailer section.
In this case,
`Repr-Digest` MAY be merged into the header section; see {{Section 6.5.1 of RFC9110}}.

## Using Repr-Digest in State-Changing Requests {#state-changing-requests}

When the representation enclosed in a state-changing request
does not describe the target resource,
the representation digest MUST be computed on the
representation data.
This is the only possible choice because representation digest requires complete
representation metadata (see {{representation-digest}}).

In responses,

- if the representation describes the status of the request,
  `Repr-Digest` MUST be computed on the enclosed representation
   (see {{post-referencing-status}} );

- if there is a referenced resource
  `Repr-Digest` MUST be computed on the selected representation of the referenced resource
   even if that is different from the target resource.
   That might or might not result in computing `Repr-Digest` on the enclosed representation.

The latter case is done according to the HTTP semantics of the given
method, for example using the `Content-Location` header field (see {{Section 8.7 of
RFC9110}}).
In contrast, the `Location` header field does not affect `Repr-Digest` because
it is not representation metadata.

For example, in `PATCH` requests, the representation digest
will be computed on the patch document
because the representation metadata refers to the patch document and not
to the target resource (see {{Section 2 of PATCH}}).
In responses, instead, the representation digest will be computed on the selected
representation of the patched resource.

## Repr-Digest and Content-Location in Responses {#digest-and-content-location}

When a state-changing method returns the `Content-Location` header field, the
enclosed representation refers to the resource identified by its value and
`Repr-Digest` is computed accordingly.
An example is given in {{post-not-request-uri}}.


# Integrity preference fields  {#want-fields}

Senders can indicate their interest in Integrity fields and hashing algorithm
preferences using the
`Want-Content-Digest` or `Want-Repr-Digest` fields. These can be used in both
requests and responses.

`Want-Content-Digest` indicates that the sender would like to receive a content digest
on messages associated with the request URI and representation metadata, using
the `Content-Digest` field.

`Want-Repr-Digest` indicates that the sender would like to receive a representation digest
on messages associated with the request URI and representation metadata, using
the `Repr-Digest` field.

If `Want-Content-Digest` or `Want-Repr-Digest` are used in a response, it
indicates that the server would like the client to provide the respective
Integrity field on future requests.

Integrity preference fields are only a hint. The receiver of the field can
ignore it and send an Integrity field using any algorithm or omit the field
entirely, for example see {{ex-server-selects-unsupported-algorithm}}. It is not
a protocol error if preferences are ignored. Applications that use Integrity
fields and Integrity preferences can define expectations or constraints that
operate in addition to this specification. How to deal with an ignored
preferences is a scenario that should be considered.

`Want-Content-Digest` and `Want-Repr-Digest` are of type `Dictionary`
where each:

* key conveys the hashing algorithm (see {{algorithms}});
* value is an `Integer` ({{Section 3.3.1 of STRUCTURED-FIELDS}})
  that conveys an ascending, relative, weighted preference.
  It must be in the range 0 to 10 inclusive.
  1 is the least preferred, 10 is the most preferred,
  and a value of 0 means "not acceptable".

Examples:

~~~ http-message
Want-Repr-Digest: sha-256=1
Want-Repr-Digest: sha-512=3, sha-256=10, unixsum=0
Want-Content-Digest: sha-256=1
Want-Content-Digest: sha-512=3, sha-256=10, unixsum=0
~~~


# Hash Algorithm Considerations and Registration {#algorithms}

There are a wide variety of hashing algorithms that can be used for the purposes
of integrity. The choice of algorithm depends on several factors such as the
integrity use case, implementation needs or constraints, or application design
and workflows.

An initial set of algorithms will be registered with IANA in the "Hash
Algorithms for HTTP Digest Fields" registry; see
{{establish-hash-algorithm-registry}}. Additional algorithms can be registered
in accordance with the policies set out in this section.

Each algorithm has a status field, which is intended to provide an aid to
implementation selection.

Algorithms with a status value of "standard" are suitable for many purposes,
including adversarial situations where hash functions might need to provide
resistance to collision, first-preimage and second-preimage attacks. For
adversarial situations, selecting which of the "standard" algorithms are
acceptable will depend on the level of protection the circumstances demand. As
there is no negotiation, endpoints that depend on a digest for security will be
vulnerable to attacks on the weakest algorithm they are willing to accept.

Algorithms with a status value of "insecure" either provide none of these
properties, or are known to be weak (see {{NO-MD5}} and {{NO-SHA}}). These
algorithms MAY be used to preserve integrity against corruption, but MUST NOT be
used in a potentially adversarial setting; for example, when signing Integrity
fields' values for authenticity.

Discussion of algorithm agility is presented in {{sec-agility}}.

Registration requests for the "Hash Algorithms for HTTP Digest Fields" registry
use the Specification Required policy ({{Section 4.6 of !RFC8126}}). Requests
should use the following template:

 - Algorithm Key: the Structured Fields key value used in
   `Content-Digest`, `Repr-Digest`, `Want-Content-Digest`, or `Want-Repr-Digest`
    field Dictionary member keys
 - Status: the status of the algorithm. The options are:
     - "standard" - for standardized algorithms without known problems,
     - "provisional" - for non-standard or unproven algorithms,
     - "insecure" - for insecure algorithms,
     - "reserved"  - for algorithms that use a reserved token value that cannot be expressed in Structured Fields
 - Description: a short description of the algorithm
 - Reference(s): pointer(s) to the primary document(s) defining the technical
   details of the algorithm, and optionally the key

When reviewing registration requests, the designated expert(s) should pay
attention to the requested status. The status value should reflect
standardization status and the broad opinion of relevant interest groups such as
the IETF or security-related SDOs. The "standard" status is not suitable for an
algorithm that is known to be weak, broken or experimental. If a registration
request attempts to register such an algorithm as "standard", the designated
expert(s) should suggest an alternative status of "insecure" or "provisional".

When reviewing registration requests, the designated expert(s) cannot use a
status of "insecure" or "provisional" as grounds for rejection.

Requests to update or change the fields in an existing registration are
permitted. For example, this could allow for the transition of an algorithm
status from "standard" to "insecure" as the security environment evolves.


# Security Considerations {#security}

## HTTP Messages Are Not Protected In Full {#sec-limitations}

This document specifies a data integrity mechanism that protects HTTP
representation data or content, but not HTTP header and trailer fields, from
certain kinds of corruption.

Integrity fields are not intended to be a general protection against malicious tampering with
HTTP messages. This can be achieved by combining it with other approaches such
as transport-layer security or digital signatures (for example, HTTP Message
Signatures {{SIGNATURES}}).

## End-to-End Integrity

Integrity fields can help detect representation data or content modification due to implementation errors,
undesired "transforming proxies" (see {{Section 7.7 of RFC9110}})
or other actions as the data passes across multiple hops or system boundaries.
Even a simple mechanism for end-to-end representation data integrity is valuable
because a user agent can validate that resource retrieval succeeded before handing off to a
HTML parser, video player etc. for parsing.

Note that using these mechanisms alone does not provide end-to-end integrity of HTTP messages over
multiple hops, since metadata could be manipulated at any stage. Methods to protect
metadata are discussed in {{usage-in-signatures}}.

## Usage in Signatures {#usage-in-signatures}

Digital signatures are widely used together with checksums to provide the
certain identification of the origin of a message [NIST800-32]. Such signatures
can protect one or more HTTP fields and there are additional considerations when
Integrity fields are included in this set.

There are no restrictions placed on the type or format of digitial signature that
Integrity fields can be used with. One possible approach is to combine them with
HTTP Message Signatures {{SIGNATURES}}.

Digests explicitly
depend on the "representation metadata" (e.g. the values of `Content-Type`,
`Content-Encoding` etc). A signature that protects Integrity fields but not other
"representation metadata" can expose the communication to tampering. For
example, an actor could manipulate the `Content-Type` field-value and cause a
digest validation failure at the recipient, preventing the application from
accessing the representation. Such an attack consumes the resources of both
endpoints. See also {{digest-and-content-location}}.

Signatures are likely to be deemed an adversarial setting
when applying Integrity fields; see {{algorithms}}.
Using signatures to protect the checksum of an empty representation
allows receiving endpoints to detect if an eventual payload has been stripped or added.

Any mangling of Integrity fields, including digests' de-duplication
or combining different field values (see {{Section 5.2 of RFC9110}})
might affect signature validation.

## Usage in Trailer Fields

Before sending Integrity fields in a trailer section, the sender
should consider that intermediaries are explicitly allowed to drop any trailer
(see {{Section 6.5.2 of RFC9110}}).

When Integrity fields are used in a trailer section, the field-values are received after the content.
Eager processing of content before the trailer section prevents digest validation, possibly leading to
processing of invalid data.

Not every hashing algorithm is suitable for use in the trailer section, some may require to pre-process
the whole payload before sending a message (e.g. see {{?I-D.thomson-http-mice}}).

## Variations Within Content Encoding

Content coding mechanisms can support different encoding parameters, meaning that the same input content can produce different outputs. For example, GZIP supports mulitple compression levels. Such encoding parameters are generally not communicated as representation metadata, for instance different compression levels would all use the same "Content-Encoding: gzip" field. Other examples include where encoding relies on nonces or timestamps, such as the aes128gcm content coding defined {{?RFC8188}}.

Since it is possible for there to be variation within content coding, the checksum conveyed by the integrity field cannot be used to provide a proof of integrity "at rest"
unless the whole (e.g. encoded) content is persisted.

## Algorithm Agility {#sec-agility}

The security properties of hashing algorithms are not fixed.
Algorithm Agility (see {{?RFC7696}}) is achieved by providing implementations with flexibility
to choose hashing algorithms from the IANA Hash Algorithms for HTTP Digest Fields registry; see
{{establish-hash-algorithm-registry}}.

Transition from weak algorithms is supported
by negotiation of hashing algorithm using `Want-Content-Digest` or `Want-Repr-Digest` (see {{want-fields}})
or by sending multiple digests from which the receiver chooses.
Endpoints are advised that sending multiple values consumes resources,
which may be wasted if the receiver ignores them (see {{representation-digest}}).

While algorithm agility allows the migration to stronger algorithms
it does not prevent the use of weaker algorithms.
Integrity fields do not provide any mitigations for downgrade or substitution
attacks (see Section 1 of {{?RFC6211}}) of the hashing algorithm.
To protect against such attacks, endpoints could restrict their set of supported algorithms
to stronger ones and protect the fields value by using TLS and/or digital signatures.

## Resource exhaustion

Integrity fields validation consumes computational resources.
In order to avoid resource exhaustion, implementations can restrict
validation of the algorithm types, number of validations, or the size of content.

# IANA Considerations

# Resource Representation and Representation Data {#resource-representation}

The following examples show how representation metadata, payload transformations
and method impacts on the message and content. When the content
contains non-printable characters (e.g. when it is compressed) it is shown as
a sequence of hex-encoded bytes.

~~~ http-message
PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/json

{"hello": "world"}
~~~
{: title="Request containing a JSON object without any content coding"}

Compression is an efficient way to reduce
the content length.

~~~ http-message
PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip

1F 8B 08 00 A5 B4 BD 62 02 FF
AB 56 4A 54 B2 52 50 32 A4 03
50 AA 05 00 44 47 2A 7C 6D 00
00 00
~~~
{: title="Request containing a gzip-encoded JSON object" #ex-put-gz}

Sending the compressed form of the content
without the correct content coding means that
the content is malformed.
In this case, the server can reply with an error.

~~~ http-message
PUT /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/json

1F 8B 08 00 A5 B4 BD 62 02 FF
AB 56 4A 54 B2 52 50 32 A4 03
50 AA 05 00 44 47 2A 7C 6D 00
00 00
~~~
{: title="Request containing malformed JSON"}

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request

~~~
{: title="An error response for a malformed content"}

A Range-Request affects the transferred message content,
conveying a partial representation of the JSON object
in {{ex-put-gz}}.

~~~ http-message
GET /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Range: bytes=1-7

~~~
{: title="Request for partial content"}

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Range: bytes 0-10/32

1F 8B 08 00 A5 B4 BD 62 02 FF
~~~
{: title="Partial response from a gzip-encoded representation"}

The method can also affect the transferred message content.
For example, the response
to a HEAD request does not carry content.

~~~ http-message
HEAD /entries/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: gzip

~~~
{: title="HEAD request"}

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip

~~~
{: title="Response to HEAD request (empty content)"}

Finally, the semantics of a response might decouple the target URI
from the enclosed representation. In the example response below, the
`Content-Location` header field indicates that the enclosed representation
refers to the resource available at `/authors/123`, even though the request is
directed to `/authors/`.

~~~ http-message
POST /authors/ HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{"author": "Camilleri"}
~~~
{: title="POST request"}

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Location: /authors/123
Location: /authors/123

{"id": "123", "author": "Camilleri"}
~~~
{: title="Response with Content-Location header"}

# Examples of Unsolicited Digest {#examples-unsolicited}

The following examples demonstrate interactions where a server responds with a
`Content-Digest` or `Repr-Digest` fields even though the client did not solicit one using
`Want-Content-Digest` or `Want-Repr-Digest`.

Some examples include JSON objects in the content.
For presentation purposes, objects that fit completely within the line-length limits
are presented on a single line using compact notation with no leading space.
Objects that would exceed line-length limits are presented across multiple lines
(one line per key-value pair) with 2 spaced of leading indentation.

Checksum mechanisms defined in this document are media-type agnostic
and do not provide canonicalization algorithms for specific formats.
Examples are calculated inclusive of any space.
While examples can include both fields,
`Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest` can be returned independently.

## Server Returns Full Representation Data {#example-full-representation}

In this example, the message content conveys complete representation data.
This means that in the response, `Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest`
are both computed over the JSON object `{"hello": "world"}`, and thus have the same value.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example

~~~
{: title="GET request for an item"}

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

HTTP/1.1 200 OK

  sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:

{"hello": "world"}
~~~
{: title="Response with identical Repr-Digest and Content-Digest"}

## Server Returns No Representation Data

In this example, a HEAD request is used to retrieve the checksum
of a resource.

The response `Content-Digest` field-value is computed on empty content.
`Repr-Digest` is calculated over the JSON object
`{"hello": "world"}`, which is not shown because there is no payload
data.


~~~ http-message
HEAD /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example

~~~

~~~ http-message

~~~
{: title="Response with both Content-Digest and Digest; empty content"}

## Server Returns Partial Representation Data

In this example, the client makes a range request and the server responds with
partial content.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Range: bytes=1-7

~~~
{: title="Request for partial content"}

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Range: bytes 1-7/18
Content-Digest: \
  sha-256=:Wqdirjg/u3J688ejbUlApbjECpiUUtIwT8lY/z81Tno=:
Repr-Digest: \
  sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:

"hello"
~~~
{: title="Partial response with both Content-Digest and Repr-Digest"}

In the response message above, note that the
`Repr-Digest` and `Content-Digests` are different.
The `Repr-Digest` field-value is calculated across the entire JSON object
`{"hello": "world"}`, and the field is

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Repr-Digest: \
  sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:
~~~

However, since the message content is constrained to bytes 1-7,
the `Content-Digest` field-value is calculated over the
byte sequence  `"hello"`, thus resulting in

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Content-Digest: \
  sha-256=:Wqdirjg/u3J688ejbUlApbjECpiUUtIwT8lY/z81Tno=:
~~~

## Client and Server Provide Full Representation Data

The request contains a `Repr-Digest` field-value calculated on the enclosed
representation. It also includes an `Accept-Encoding: br` header field that advertises the
client supports Brotli encoding.

The response includes a `Content-Encoding: br` that indicates the selected
representation is Brotli-encoded. The `Repr-Digest` field-value is therefore
different compared to the request.

For presentation purposes, the response body is displayed as a sequence of
hex-encoded bytes because it contains non-printable characters.

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

## Client Provides Full Representation Data, Server Provides No Representation Data

The request `Repr-Digest` field-value is calculated on the enclosed content.

The response `Repr-Digest` field-value
depends on the representation metadata header fields, including
`Content-Encoding: br` even when the response does not contain content.


~~~ http-message

{: title="Response with Digest of Encoded Content"}

## POST Response does not Reference the Request URI {#post-not-request-uri}

The request `Repr-Digest` field-value is computed on the enclosed representation (see
{{state-changing-requests}}).

The representation enclosed in the response refers to the resource identified by
`Content-Location` (see {{Section 6.4.2 of RFC9110}});
an application can thus use `Repr-Digest` in association with the resource
referenced by `Content-Location`.

~~~ http-message
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: identity
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:bWopGGNiZtbVgHsG+I4knzfEJpmmmQHf7RHDXA3o1hQ=:

{"title": "New Title"}
~~~
{: title="POST Request with Digest"}

{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "New Title"
}
~~~
{: title="Response with Digest of Resource"}

## POST Response Describes the Request Status {#post-referencing-status}

The request `Repr-Digest` field-value is computed on the enclosed representation (see
{{state-changing-requests}}).

The representation enclosed in the response describes the status of the request,
so `Repr-Digest` is computed on that enclosed representation.

Response `Repr-Digest` has no explicit relation with the resource referenced by
`Location`.

~~~ http-message
POST /books HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: identity
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:bWopGGNiZtbVgHsG+I4knzfEJpmmmQHf7RHDXA3o1hQ=:

{"title": "New Title"}
~~~
{: title="POST Request with Digest"}

~~~ http-message

Location: /books/123

{
  "status": "created",
  "id": "123",
  "ts": 1569327729,
  "instance": "/books/123"
}
~~~
{: title="Response with Digest of Representation"}


## Digest with PATCH

This case is analogous to a POST request where the target resource reflects the
target URI.

The PATCH request uses the `application/merge-patch+json` media type defined in
{{?RFC7396}}.

`Repr-Digest` is calculated on the enclosed payload, which corresponds to the patch
document.

The response `Repr-Digest` field-value is computed on the complete representation of the patched
resource.

~~~ http-message
PATCH /books/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json
Accept: application/json
Accept-Encoding: identity
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:bWopGGNiZtbVgHsG+I4knzfEJpmmmQHf7RHDXA3o1hQ=:

{"title": "New Title"}
~~~
{: #fig-patch title="PATCH Request with Digest"}

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:yxOAqEeoj+reqygSIsLpT0LhumrNkIds5uLKtmdLyYE=:

{
  "id": "123",
  "title": "New Title"
}
~~~
{: title="Response with Digest of Representation"}

Note that a `204 No Content` response without content but with the same
`Repr-Digest` field-value would have been legitimate too.
In that case, `Content-Digest` would have been computed on an empty content.

## Error responses

In error responses, the representation data does not necessarily refer to the
target resource. Instead, it refers to the representation of the error.

In the following example, a client sends the same request from {{fig-patch}} to
patch the resource located at /books/123. However, the resource does not exist
and the server generates a 404 response with a body that describes the error in
accordance with {{?RFC7807}}.

The response `Repr-Digest` field-value is computed on this enclosed representation.

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/problem+json
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:KPqhVXAT25LLitV1w0O167unHmVQusu+fpxm65zAsvk=:

{
  "title": "Not Found",
  "detail": "Cannot PATCH a non-existent resource",
  "status": 404
}
~~~
{: title="Response with Digest of Error Representation"}

## Use with Trailer Fields and Transfer Coding

An origin server sends `Repr-Digest` as trailer field, so it can calculate digest-value
while streaming content and thus mitigate resource consumption.
The `Repr-Digest` field-value is the same as in {{example-full-representation}} because `Repr-Digest` is designed to
be independent from the use of one or more transfer codings (see {{representation-digest}}).

In the response content below, the string "\r\n" represent the bytes CRLF.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example

~~~
{: title="GET Request"}

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Trailer: Digest

{"hello"\r\n
8\r\n

2\r\n

0\r\n
Repr-Digest:
  sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:\r\n

~~~
{: title="Chunked Response with Digest"}


# Examples of Want-Repr-Digest Solicited Digest {#examples-solicited}

The following examples demonstrate interactions where a client solicits a
`Repr-Digest` using `Want-Repr-Digest`.
The behavior of `Content-Digest` and `Want-Content-Digest` is identical.

Some examples include JSON objects in the content.
For presentation purposes, objects that fit completely within the line-length limits
are presented on a single line using compact notation with no leading space.
Objects that would exceed line-length limits are presented across multiple lines
(one line per key-value pair) with 2 spaced of leading indentation.

Checksum mechanisms described in this document are media-type agnostic
and do not provide canonicalization algorithms for specific formats.
Examples are calculated inclusive of any space.

## Server Selects Client's Least Preferred Algorithm

The client requests a digest, preferring "sha". The server is free to reply with
"sha-256" anyway.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Want-Repr-Digest: sha-256=3, sha=10

~~~
{: title="GET Request with Want-Repr-Digest"}

  sha-256=:X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=:

{"hello": "world"}
~~~
{: title="Response with Different Algorithm"}

##  Server Selects Algorithm Unsupported by Client {#ex-server-selects-unsupported-algorithm}

The client requests a "sha" digest because that is the only algorithm it
supports. The server is not obliged to produce a response containing a "sha"
digest, it instead uses a different algorithm.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: foo.example
Want-Repr-Digest: sha=10

~~~

  iYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==:

{"hello": "world"}
~~~
{: title="Response with Unsupported Algorithm"}

## Server Does Not Support Client Algorithm and Returns an Error

{{ex-server-selects-unsupported-algorithm}} is an example where a server ignores
the client's preferred digest algorithm.
Alternatively a server can also reject
the request and return a response with
error status code such as 4xx or 5xx.
This specification does not prescribe
any requirement on status code selection;
the follow example illustrates one possible
option.

In this example, the client requests a "sha" `Repr-Digest`, and the server returns an
error with problem details {{?RFC7807}} contained in the content. The problem
details contain a list of the hashing algorithms that the server supports. This
is purely an example, this specification does not define any format or
requirements for such content.

~~~ http-message
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1

# Sample Digest Values

This section shows examples of digest values for different hashing algorithms.
The input value is the JSON object `{"hello": "world"}`. The digest values are
each produced by running the relevant hashing algorithm over the input and
running the output bytes through `Byte Sequence` serialization; see {{Section
4.1.8 of STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}.

# Migrating from RFC 3230

HTTP digests are computed by applying a hashing algorithm to input data.
RFC 3230 defined the input data as an "instance", a term it also defined.
The concept of instance has since been superseded by the HTTP semantic term "representation".
It is understood that some implementations of RFC 3230
mistook "instance" to mean HTTP content.
Using content for the Digest field is an error
that leads to interoperability problems between peers that implement RFC 3230.

RFC 3230 was only ever intended
to use what HTTP now defines as selected representation data.
The semantic concept of digest and representation are explained
alongside the definition of [the Repr-Digest field](#representation-digest).

While the syntax of Digest and Repr-Digest are different,
the considerations and examples this document gives for Repr-Digest
apply equally to Digest because they operate on the same input data;
see {{state-changing-requests}}, {{security}} and {{usage-in-signatures}}.

RFC 3230 could never communicate
the digest of HTTP message content in the Digest field;
Content-Digest now provides that capability.

RFC 3230 allowed algorithms to define their output encoding format for use with
the Digest field. This resulted in a mixed of formats such as base64, hex or
decimal. By virtue of using Structured fields, Content-Digest and Repr-Digest
use only a single encoding format. Further explanation and examples are provided in {{sample-digest-values}}.

# Code Samples
{:numbered="false" removeinrfc="true"}

How can I generate and validate the `Repr-Digest` values shown in the examples
throughout this document?

The following python3 code can be used to generate digests for JSON objects
using SHA algorithms for a range of encodings. Note that these are formatted as
base64. This function could be adapted to other algorithms and should take into
account their specific formatting rules.

~~~
import base64, json, hashlib, brotli, logging
log = logging.getLogger()

def encode_item(item, encoding=lambda x: x):
    indent = 2 if isinstance(item, dict) and len(item) > 1 else None
    json_bytes = json.dumps(item, indent=indent).encode()
    return encoding(json_bytes)

def digest_bytes(bytes_, algorithm=hashlib.sha256):
    checksum_bytes = algorithm(bytes_).digest()
    log.warning("Log bytes: \n[%r]", bytes_)
    return base64.encodebytes(checksum_bytes).strip()

def digest(item, encoding=lambda x: x, algorithm=hashlib.sha256):
    content_encoded = encode_item(item, encoding)
    return digest_bytes(content_encoded, algorithm)
