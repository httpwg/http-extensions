# Introduction

This document describes a use of HTTP Alternative Services {{RFC7838}} to decouple
the URI scheme from the use and configuration of underlying encryption, allowing a `http` URI
{{RFC7230}} to be accessed using Transport Layer Security (TLS) {{RFC5246}} opportunistically.

Serving `https` URIs requires avoiding Mixed Content {{W3C.CR-mixed-content-20160802}}, which is
problematic in many deployments. This document describes a usage model whereby sites can serve
`http` URIs over TLS, thereby avoiding these issues, while still providing protection against
passive attacks.

Opportunistic Security {{RFC7435}} does not provide the same guarantees as using TLS with `https`
URIs; it is vulnerable to active attacks, and does not change the security context of the
connection. Normally, users will not be able to tell that it is in use (i.e., there will be no
"lock icon").


## Goals and Non-Goals

The immediate goal is to make the use of HTTP more robust in the face of pervasive passive
monitoring {{RFC7258}}.

A secondary (but significant) goal is to provide for ease of implementation, deployment and
operation. This mechanism is expected to have a minimal impact upon performance, and require a
trivial administrative effort to configure.

Preventing active attacks (such as a Man-in-the-Middle) is a non-goal for this specification.
Furthermore, this specification is not intended to replace or offer an alternative to `https`,
since it both prevents active attacks and invokes a more stringent security model in most clients.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
{{RFC2119}}.


# Using HTTP URIs over TLS

An origin server that supports the resolution of `http` URIs can indicate support for this
specification by providing an alternative service advertisement {{RFC7838}} for a protocol
identifier that uses TLS, such as `h2` {{RFC7540}}.

A client that receives such an advertisement MAY make future requests intended for the associated
origin ({{RFC6454}}) to the identified service (as specified by {{RFC7838}}), provided that the alternative service opts in as described in {{auth}}.

A client that places the importance of protection against passive attacks over performance might
choose to withhold requests until an encrypted connection is available. However, if such a
connection cannot be successfully established, the client can resume its use of the cleartext
connection.

A client can also explicitly probe for an alternative service advertisement by sending a request
that bears little or no sensitive information, such as one with the OPTIONS method. Likewise,
clients with existing alternative services information could make such a request before they expire,
in order minimize the delays that might be incurred.

Client certificates are not meaningful for URLs with the `http` scheme, and therefore clients
creating new TLS connections to alternative services for the purposes of this specification MUST
NOT present them. Established connections with client certificates MAY be reused, however.


## Alternative Server Opt-In {#auth}

It is possible that the server might become confused about whether requests' URLs have a `http` or
`https` scheme, for various reasons; see {{confuse}}. To ensure that the alternative service has
opted into serving `http` URLs over TLS, clients are required to perform additional checks before
directing `http` requests to it.

Clients MUST NOT send `http` requests over a connection with the `h2` protocol identifier, unless
they have obtained a valid http-opportunistic response for an origin (as per {{well-known}}), and:

* The chosen alternative service presents a certificate that is valid for the origin, as per
  {{RFC2818}} (this also establishes "reasonable assurances" for the purposes of {RFC7838}}), and

* The origin object of the http-opportunistic response has a `tls-ports' member, whose value is an
  array of numbers, one of which matches the port of the alternative service in question, and

* The chosen alternative service returns the same representation as the origin did for the
  http-opportunistic resource.

For example, this request/response pair would allow reqeusts for the origin
"http://www.example.com" to be sent to an alternative service on port 443 or 8000 of the host
"www.example.com":

~~~ example
GET /.well-known/http-opportunistic HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: close

{
  "http://www.example.com": {
    "tls-ports": [443, 8000],
    "lifetime": 2592000
  }
}
~~~



## Interaction with "https" URIs

When using alternative services, requests for resources identified by both `http` and `https` URIs
might use the same connection, because HTTP/2 permits requests for multiple origins on the same
connection.

Because of the risk of server confusion about individual requests' schemes (see {{confuse}}),
clients MUST NOT `http` requests on a connection that would ordinarily be used for `https`
requests, unless the http-opportunistic origin object {{well-known}} for that origin has a
"mixed-scheme" member whose value is "true".


## The "http-opportunistic" well-known URI {#well-known}

This specification defines the "http-opportunistic" well-known URI {{RFC5785}}. A client is said
to have a valid http-opportunistic response for a given origin when:

* The client has obtained a 200 (OK) response for the well-known URI from the origin, and it is
  fresh {{RFC7234}} (potentially through revalidation {{RFC7232}}), and

* That response has the media type "application/json", and

* That response's payload, when parsed as JSON {{RFC7159}}, contains an object as the root, and

* The root object contains a member whose name is a case-insensitive
  character-for-character match for the origin in question, serialised into Unicode as per Section
  6.1 of {{RFC6454}}, and whose value is an object (hereafter, the "origin object"),

* The origin object has a "lifetime" member, whose value is a number indicating the number of
  seconds which the origin object is valid for (hereafter, the "origin object lifetime"), and

* The origin object lifetime is greater than the `current_age` (as per {{RFC7234}}, Section 4.2.3).

Note that origin object lifetime might differ from the freshness lifetime of the response.


# IANA Considerations

This specification registers a Well-Known URI {{RFC5785}}:

* URI Suffix: http-opportunistic
* Change Controller: IETF
* Specification Document(s): {{well-known}} of \[this specification\]

# Security Considerations {#security}

## Security Indicators

User Agents MUST NOT provide any special security indicia when an `http` resource is acquired using
TLS. In particular, indicators that might suggest the same level of security as `https` MUST NOT be
used (e.g.,  a "lock device").


## Downgrade Attacks {#downgrade}

A downgrade attack against the negotiation for TLS is possible. 

For example, because the `Alt-Svc` header field {{RFC7838}} likely appears in an unauthenticated
and unencrypted channel, it is subject to downgrade by network attackers. In its simplest form, an
attacker that wants the connection to remain in the clear need only strip the `Alt-Svc` header
field from responses.


## Privacy Considerations {#privacy}

Cached alternative services can be used to track clients over time; e.g., using a user-specific
hostname. Clearing the cache reduces the ability of servers to track clients; therefore clients
MUST clear cached alternative service information when clearing other origin-based state (i.e.,
cookies).


## Confusion Regarding Request Scheme {#confuse}

HTTP implementations and applications sometimes use ambient signals to determine if a request is
for an `https` resource; for example, they might look for TLS on the stack, or a server port number
of 443.

This might be due to limitations in the protocol (the most common HTTP/1.1 request form does
not carry an explicit indication of the URI scheme), or it may be because how the server and
application are implemented (often, they are two separate entities, with a variety of possible
interfaces between them).

Any security decisions based upon this information could be misled by the deployment of this
specification, because it violates the assumption that the use of TLS (or port 443) means that the
client is accessing a HTTPS URI, and operating in the security context implied by HTTPS.

Therefore, servers need to carefully examine the use of such signals before deploying this
specification.


## Server Controls

This specification requires that a server send both an Alternative Service advertisement and host
content in a well-known location to send HTTP requests over TLS. Servers SHOULD take suitable
measures to ensure that the content of the well-known resource remains under their control.
Likewise, because the Alt-Svc header field is used to describe policies across an entire origin,
servers SHOULD NOT permit user content to set or modify the value of this header.
