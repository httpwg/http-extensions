certificate-based credentials after a TLS connection is established, based
on TLS Exported Authenticators.

# Introduction

HTTP {{!HTTP=RFC9110}} clients need to know that the content they receive on a
connection comes from the origin from which they intended to retrieve it. The
traditional form of server authentication in HTTP has been in the form of a
single X.509 certificate provided during the TLS {{!TLS13=RFC8446}} handshake.

TLS supports one server and one client certificate on a connection. These
certificates may contain multiple identities, but only one certificate may be
provided.

Many HTTP servers host content from several origins. HTTP/2 {{!H2=RFC9113}} and
HTTP/3 {{!H3=RFC9114}} permit clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a
server provided that the secondary origin is also in the certificate provided
during the TLS handshake. In many cases, servers choose to maintain separate
certificates for different origins but still desire the benefits of a shared
HTTP connection. This document defines a capability for servers to use and
to authenticate with those seperate certificates over a shared connection.

The ability to maintain seperate certificates for different origins can also
allow proxies that cache content from secondary origins to communicate to
clients that they can service some of those origins directly, allowing the
proxy to behave as a TLS-terminating reverse proxy for those origins instead of
establishing a TLS encrypted tunnel through the proxy.

## Server Certificate Authentication

{{Section 9.1.1 of H2}} and {{Section 3.3 of H3}} describe how connections may
be used to make requests from multiple origins as long as the server is
authoritative for both. A server is considered authoritative for an origin if
DNS resolves the origin to the IP address of the server and (for TLS) if the
certificate presented by the server contains the origin in the Subject
Alternative Names field.

{{?ALTSVC=RFC7838}} enables a step of abstraction from the DNS resolution. If
both hosts have provided an Alternative Service at hostnames which resolve to
the IP address of the server, they are considered authoritative just as if DNS
resolved the origin itself to that address. However, the server's one TLS
certificate is still required to contain the name of each origin in question.

{{?ORIGIN=RFC8336}} relaxes the requirement to perform the DNS lookup if already
connected to a server with an appropriate certificate which claims support for
a particular origin.

Servers which host many origins often would prefer to have separate certificates
for some sets of origins. This may be for ease of certificate management
(the ability to separately revoke or renew them), due to different sources of
certificates (a CDN acting on behalf of multiple origins), or other factors
which might drive this administrative decision. Clients connecting to such
origins cannot currently reuse connections, even if both client and server
would prefer to do so.

Because the TLS SNI extension is exchanged in the clear, clients might also
prefer to retrieve certificates inside the encrypted context. When this
information is sensitive, it might be advantageous to request a general-purpose
certificate or anonymous ciphersuite at the TLS layer, while acquiring the
"real" certificate in HTTP after the connection is established.

## TLS Exported Authenticators

TLS Exported Authenticators {{!EXPORTED-AUTH=RFC9261}} are structured messages
that can be exported by either party of a TLS connection and validated by the
other party. Given an established TLS connection, an authenticator message can
be constructed proving possession of a certificate and a corresponding private
key. The mechanisms that this document defines are primarily focused on the
server's ability to generate TLS Exported Authenticators.

Each Authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished MAC Key
derived from the TLS session. The Handshake Context is identical for both
parties of the TLS connection, while the Finished MAC Key is dependent on
whether the Authenticator is created by the client or the server.

Successfully verified Authenticators result in certificate chains, with verified
possession of the corresponding private key, which can be supplied into a
collection of available certificates. Likewise, descriptions of desired
certificates can also be supplied into these collections.

## HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

This document defines HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 `CERTIFICATE` frames ({{certs-http}}) to
carry the relevant certificate messages, enabling certificate-based
authentication of servers independent of TLS version. This mechanism can be
implemented at the HTTP layer without breaking the existing interface between
HTTP and applications above it.

TLS Exported Authenticators {{EXPORTED-AUTH}} allow the opportunity for an
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers to send certificate frames which can be used to prove
the servers authenticity for multiple origins.

This document additionally defines SETTINGS parameters for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
({{settings}}) that allow the client and server to indicate support for
HTTP-Layer certificate authentication.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Discovering Additional Certificates at the HTTP Layer {#discovery}

A certificate chain with proof of possession of the private key corresponding to
the end-entity certificate is sent as a sequence of `CERTIFICATE` frames (see
{{http2-cert}}, {{http3-cert}}) to the client. Once the holder of a certificate
has sent the chain and proof, this certificate chain is cached by the recipient
and available for future use.

## Indicating Support for HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication {#settings-usage}

The `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH` parameters for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 are
defined in {{settings}} so that clients and servers can indicate support for
secondary certificate authentication of servers.

HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 endpoints who wish to indicate support for HTTP-Layer
certificate authentication MUST send a `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH`
parameter set to "1" in their SETTINGS frame. Endpoints MUST NOT use any of the
authentication functionality described in this document unless the parameter has
been negotiated by both sides.

Endpoints MUST NOT send a `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH` parameter with a
value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1.

`SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH` indicates that servers are able to offer
additional certificates to demonstrate control over other origin hostnames, and
that clients are able to make requests for hostnames received in a TLS Exported
Authenticator that the server sends.

## Making Certificates Available {#cert-available}

When both peers have advertised support for HTTP-layer certificates in a given
direction as in {{settings-usage}}, the indicated endpoint can supply
additional certificates into the connection at any time. That is, if both
endpoints have sent `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH` and validated the value
received from the peer, the server may send certificates spontaneously, at any
time, as described by the `Spontaneous Server Authentication` message sequence
in {{Section 3 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}.

This does mean that if a server knows it supports secondary certificate
authentication, and it receives `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH` from the
client, that it can enqueue certificates immediately following the received
SETTINGS frame.

Certificates supplied by servers can be considered by clients without further
action by the server. A server SHOULD NOT send certificates which do not cover
origins which it is prepared to service on the current connection, and SHOULD
NOT send them if the client has not indicated support with
`SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH`.

A client MUST NOT send certificates to the server. The server SHOULD close the
connection upon receipt of a CERTIFICATE frame from a client.

   <----------------------- (stream N) 200 OK ---
~~~
{: #ex-http-server-unprompted-basic title="Simple unprompted server authentication"}

A server MAY send a `CERTIFICATE` immediately after sending its `SETTINGS`.
However, it MAY also send certificates at any time later. For example, a proxy
might discover that a client is interested in an origin that it can reverse
proxy at the time that a client sends a `CONNECT` request. It can then send
certificates for those origins to allow for TLS-terminated reverse proxying to
those origins for the remainder of the connection lifetime.
{{ex-http-server-unprompted-reverse}} illustrates this behavior.

# SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH {#settings}
SETTINGS parameters for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 seperately are defined below.

## The SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameter{#http2-setting}
This document adds a new HTTP/2 SETTINGS(0xTBD) parameter to those defined by
{{Section 6.5.2 of H2}}.

The new parameter name is `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH`. The value of the
parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

The usage of this parameter is described in {{settings-usage}}.

## The SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH HTTP/3 SETTINGS Parameter{#http3-setting}
This document adds a new HTTP/3 SETTINGS(0xTBD) parameter to those defined by
{{Section 7.2.4.1 of H3}}.

The new parameter name is `SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH`. The value of the
parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

The usage of this parameter is described in {{settings-usage}}.

# CERTIFICATE frame {#certs-http}

The CERTIFICATE frame contains an exported authenticator message from the TLS
layer that provides a chain of certificates and associated extensions, proving
possession of the private key corresponding to the end-entity certificate.

A server sends a CERTIFICATE frame on stream 0 for HTTP/2 and on the control
stream for HTTP/3. The client is permitted to make subsequent requests for
resources upon receipt of a CERTIFICATE frame without further action from the
server.

Upon receiving a complete series of CERTIFICATE frames, the receiver may
validate the Exported Authenticator value by using the exported authenticator
API. This returns either an error indicating that the message was invalid or
the certificate chain and extensions used to create the message.

## HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE frame {#http2-cert}
A CERTIFICATE frame in HTTP/2 (type=0xTBD) carrries a TLS Exported authenticator
that clients can use to authenticate secondary origins from a sending server.

The CERTIFICATE frame MUST be sent on stream 0. A CERTIFICATE frame received on
any other stream MUST not be used for server authentication.

~~~~~~~~~~ ascii-art
CERTIFICATE Frame {
  Length (24),
  Type (8) = 0xTBD,

  Unused Flags (8),

  Reserved (1),
  Stream Identifier (31) = 0,

  Authenticator (..),
}
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="HTTP/2 CERTIFICATE Frame"}

The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier fields are
described in {{Section 4 of H2}}.

The CERTIFICATE frame does not define any flags.

The authenticator field is a portion of the opaque data returned from the TLS
connection exported authenticator authenticate API. See {{exp-auth}} for more
details on the input to this API.

The CERTIFICATE frame applies to the connection, not a specific stream. An
endpoint MUST treat a CERTIFICATE frame with a stream identifier other than
0x00 as a connection error.

## HTTP/3 CERTIFICATE frame {#http3-cert}
A CERTIFICATE frame in HTTP/3 (type=0xTBD) carrries a TLS Exported authenticator
that clients can use to authenticate secondary origins from a sending server.

The CERTIFICATE frame MUST be sent on the control stream. A CERTIFICATE frame
received on any other stream MUST not be used for server authentication.

~~~~~~~~~~ ascii-art
CERTIFICATE Frame {
  Type (i) = 0xTBD,
  Length (i),
  Authenticator (...),
}
~~~~~~~~~~
{: title="HTTP/3 CERTIFICATE Frame"}

The Type and Length fields are described in {{Section 7.1 of H3}}.

The authenticator field is a portion of the opaque data returned from the TLS
connection exported authenticator authenticate API. See {{exp-auth}} for more
details on the input to this API.

The CERTIFICATE frame applies to the connection, not a specific stream. An
endpoint MUST treat a CERTIFICATE frame received on any stream other than the
control stream as a connection error.

## Exported Authenticator Characteristics {#exp-auth}

The Exported Authenticator API defined in {{EXPORTED-AUTH}} takes as input a
request, a set of certificates, and supporting information about the
certificate (OCSP, SCT, etc.). The result is an opaque token which is used
when generating the `CERTIFICATE` frame.

Upon receipt of a `CERTIFICATE` frame, an endpoint which has negotiated support
for secondary certfiicates MUST perform the following steps to validate the
token it contains:

- Using the `get context` API, retrieve the `certificate_request_context` used
  to generate the authenticator, if any. Because the `certificate_request_context`
  for spontaneous server certificates is chosen by the server, the usage of
  the `certificate_request_context` is implementation-dependent. For details,
  see {{Section 5 of EXPORTED-AUTH}}.
- Use the `validate` API to confirm the validity of the authenticator with
  regard to the generated request, if any.

If the authenticator cannot be validated, this SHOULD be treated as a connection
error.

Once the authenticator is accepted, the endpoint can perform any other checks
for the acceptability of the certificate itself.

# Indicating Failures During HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication {#errors}

Because this document permits certificates to be exchanged at the HTTP framing
layer instead of the TLS layer, several certificate-related errors which are
defined at the TLS layer might now occur at the HTTP framing layer.

There are two classes of errors which might be encountered, and they are handled
differently.

## Misbehavior

This category of errors could indicate a peer failing to follow requirements in
this document or might indicate that the connection is not fully secure. These
errors are fatal to stream or connection, as appropriate.

CERTIFICATE_UNREADABLE (0xERROR-TBD):
: An exported authenticator could not be validated.

## Invalid Certificates
Unacceptable certificates (expired, revoked, or insufficient to satisfy the
request) are not treated as stream or connection errors. This is typically not
an indication of a protocol failure. Clients SHOULD establish a new connection
in an attempt to reach an authoritative server if they deem a
certificate from the server unacceptable.

# Security Considerations {#security}

This mechanism defines an alternate way to obtain server and client certificates
other than in the initial TLS handshake. While the signature of exported
authenticator values is expected to be equally secure, it is important to
recognize that a vulnerability in this code path is at least equal to a
vulnerability in the TLS handshake.

## Impersonation

This mechanism could increase the impact of a key compromise. Rather than
needing to subvert DNS or IP routing in order to use a compromised certificate,
a malicious server now only needs a client to connect to *some* HTTPS site
under its control in order to present the compromised certificate. Clients
SHOULD consult DNS for hostnames presented in secondary certificates if they
would have done so for the same hostname if it were present in the primary
certificate.

As recommended in {{ORIGIN}}, clients opting not to consult DNS ought to employ
some alternative means to increase confidence that the certificate is
legitimate, such as an `ORIGIN` frame.

As noted in the Security Considerations of {{EXPORTED-AUTH}}, it is difficult to
formally prove that an endpoint is jointly authoritative over multiple
certificates, rather than individually authoritative on each certificate. As a
result, clients MUST NOT assume that because one origin was previously
colocated with another, those origins will be reachable via the same endpoints
in the future. Clients MUST NOT consider previous secondary certificates to be
validated after TLS session resumption. Servers MAY re-present certificates
if a TLS Session is resumed.

## Fingerprinting

This document defines a mechanism which could be used to probe servers for origins
they support, but it opens no new attack that was not already possible by
making repeat TLS connections with different SNI values.

## Persistence of Service

CNAME records in the DNS are frequently used to delegate authority for an origin
to a third-party provider. This delegation can be changed without notice, even
to the third-party provider, simply by modifying the CNAME record in question.

After the owner of the domain has redirected traffic elsewhere by changing the
CNAME, new connections will not arrive for that origin, but connections which
are properly directed to this provider for other origins would continue to
claim control of this origin (via Secondary Certificates). This is proper
behavior based on the third-party provider's configuration, but would likely
not be what is intended by the owner of the origin.

This is not an issue which can be mitigated by the protocol, but something about
which third-party providers SHOULD educate their customers before using the
features described in this document.

## Confusion About State
Implementations need to be aware of the potential for confusion about the state
of a connection. The presence or absence of a validated certificate can change
during the processing of a request, potentially multiple times, as
`CERTIFICATE` frames are received. A client that uses certificate
authentication needs to be prepared to reevaluate the authorization state of a
request as the set of certificates changes.

Behavior for TLS-Terminated reverse proxies is also worth considering. If a
server which situationally reverse-proxies wishes for the client to view a
request made prior to receipt of certificates as TLS-Terminated, or wishes for
the client to start a new tunnel alternatively, this document does not currently
define formal mechanisms to facilitate that intention.
