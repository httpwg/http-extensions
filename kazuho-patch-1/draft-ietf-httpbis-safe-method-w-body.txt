                         The HTTP QUERY Method
              draft-ietf-httpbis-safe-method-w-body-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines the QUERY method for HTTP.  A QUERY
   requests that the request target process the enclosed content in a
   safe/idempotent manner and then respond with the result of that
   processing.  This is similar to POST requests but can be
   automatically repeated or restarted without concern for partial state
   changes.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines the HTTP QUERY request method as a means
   of making a safe, idempotent request (Section 9.2 of [HTTP])
   containing content that describes how the request is to be processed
   by the target resource.

   Most often, this is desirable when the data conveyed in a request is
   too voluminous to be encoded into the request's URI.  For example,
   this is a common query pattern:

   GET /feed?q=foo&limit=10&sort=-published HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org

   However, for a query with parameters that are complex or large,
   encoding it in the request URI may not be the best option because

   *  often size limits are not known ahead of time because a request
      can pass through many uncoordinated systems (but note that
      Section 4.1 of [HTTP] recommends senders and recipients to support
      at least 8000 octets),

   *  expressing certain kinds of data in the target URI is inefficient
      because of the overhead of encoding that data into a valid URI,
      and

   *  encoding queries directly into the request URI effectively casts
      every possible combination of query inputs as distinct resources.

   As an alternative to using GET, many implementations make use of the
   HTTP POST method to perform queries, as illustrated in the example
   below.  In this case, the input to the query operation is passed as
   the request content as opposed to using the request URI's query
   component.

   A typical use of HTTP POST for requesting a query is:

   POST /feed HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   q=foo&limit=10&sort=-published

   This variation, however, suffers from the same basic limitation as
   GET in that it is not readily apparent -- absent specific knowledge
   of the resource and server to which the request is being sent -- that
   a safe, idempotent query is being performed.

   The QUERY method provides a solution that spans the gap between the
   use of GET and POST, with the example above being expressed as:

   QUERY /feed HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

   q=foo&limit=10&sort=-published

   As with POST, the input to the query operation is passed as the
   content of the request rather than as part of the request URI.
   Unlike POST, however, the method is explicitly safe and idempotent,
   allowing functions like caching and automatic retries to operate.

   Summarizing:

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology defined in Section 3 of [HTTP].

   Furthermore, it uses the terms _URI query parameter_ for parameters
   in the query component of a URI (Section 4.2.2 of [HTTP]) and _query
   content_ for the request content (Section 6.4 of [HTTP]) of a QUERY
   request.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  QUERY

   The QUERY method is used to initiate a server-side query.  Unlike the
   HTTP GET method, which requests that a server return a representation
   of the resource identified by the target URI (as defined by
   Section 7.1 of [HTTP]), the QUERY method is used to ask the server to
   perform a query operation (described by the request content) over
   some set of data at the resource.  The content returned in response
   to a QUERY cannot be assumed to be a representation of the resource
   identified by the target URI.

   The content of the request and it's media type define the query.
   Implementations MAY use a request content of any media type with the
   QUERY method, provided that it has appropriate query semantics.

   As for all HTTP methods in general, the target URI's query part takes
   part in identifying the resource being queried and therefore is not
   part of the actual query.  Whether and how the URI's query part
   directly affects the result of the query is implementation specific
   and out of scope for this specification.

   QUERY requests are both safe and idempotent with regard to the
   resource identified by the request URI.  That is, QUERY requests do
   not alter the state of the identified resource.  However, while
   processing a QUERY request, a server can be expected to allocate
   computing and memory resources or even create additional HTTP
   resources through which the response can be retrieved.

   A successful response to a QUERY request is expected to provide some
   indication as to the final disposition of the operation.  For
   instance, a successful query that yields no results can be
   represented by a 204 (No Content, Section 15.3.5 of [HTTP]) response.
   If the response includes content, it is expected to describe the
   results of the operation.

2.1.  Content-Location Response Field

   A successful response (2xx, Section 15.3 of [HTTP]) can include a
   Content-Location header field containing an identifier for a resource
   corresponding to the results of the operation; see Section 8.7 of
   [HTTP] for details.  This represents a claim from the server that a
   client can send a GET request for the indicated URI to retrieve the
   results of the query operation just performed.  The indicated
   resource might be temporary.

   See Appendix A.4.1 for an example.

2.2.  Location Response Field

   A server can create or locate a resource that identifies the query
   operation for future use.  If the server does so, the URI of the
   resource can be included in the Location header field of the 2xx
   response (see Section 10.2.2 of [HTTP]).  This represents a claim
   that a client can send a GET request to the indicated URI to repeat
   the query operation just performed without resending the query
   content.  This resource might be temporary; if a future request
   fails, the client can retry using the original QUERY resource and the
   previously submitted content.

   See Appendix A.4.2 for an example.

2.3.  Redirection

   In some cases, the server may choose to respond indirectly to the
   QUERY request by redirecting the user agent to a different URI (see
   Section 15.4 of [HTTP]).  The semantics of the redirect response do
   not differ from other methods.

   For instance, a 303 (See Other, Section 15.4.4 of [HTTP]) response
   would indicate that the Location field identifies an alternate URI
   from which the results can be retrieved using a GET request (this use
   case is also covered by the use of the Location response field in a
   2xx response).

   On the other hand, response codes 307 (Temporary Redirect,
   Section 15.4.8 of [HTTP]) and 308 (Permanent Redirect, Section 15.4.9
   of [HTTP]) can be used to request the user agent to redo the QUERY
   request on the URI specified by the Location field.

   Various non-normative examples of successful QUERY responses are
   illustrated in Appendix A.

2.4.  Conditional Requests

   A conditional QUERY requests that the selected representation (i.e.,
   the query results, after any content negotiation) be returned in the
   response only under the circumstances described by the conditional
   header field(s), as defined in Section 13 of [HTTP].

2.5.  Caching

   The response to a QUERY method is cacheable; a cache MAY use it to
   satisfy subsequent QUERY requests as per Section 4 of
   [HTTP-CACHING]).

   The cache key for a QUERY request (see Section 2 of [HTTP-CACHING])
   MUST incorporate the request content.

   Caches MAY remove semantically insignificant differences first,
   thereby improving cache efficiency.

   For instance, by

   *  removing content encoding(s) (Section 8.4 of [HTTP]).

   *  normalizing based upon knowledge of format conventions, as
      indicated by any media subtype suffix in the request's Content-
      Type field (e.g., "+json", see Section 4.2.8 of [RFC6838]).

   *  normalizing based upon knowledge of the semantics of the content
      itself, as indicated by the request's Content-Type field.

   Note that any such transformation is performed solely for the purpose
   of generating a cache key; it does not change the request itself.

   Clients can indicate, using the "no-transform" cache directive
   (Section 5.2.1.6 of [HTTP-CACHING]), that they wish that no such
   transformation happens (but note that this directive is just
   advisory).

2.6.  Range Requests

   The semantics of Range Requests for QUERY are identical to those for
   GET, as defined in Section 14 of [HTTP].

3.  The "Accept-Query" Header Field

   The "Accept-Query" response header field can be used by a resource to
   directly signal support for the QUERY method while identifying the
   specific query format media type(s) that may be used.

   Accept-Query contains a list of media ranges (Section 12.5.1 of
   [HTTP]) using "Structured Fields" syntax ([STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).
   Media ranges are represented by a List Structured Header Field of
   either Tokens or Strings, containing the media range value without
   parameters.

   Media type parameters, if any, are mapped to Structured Field
   Parameters of type String or Token.  The choice of Token vs. String
   is semantically insignificant.  That is, recipients MAY convert
   Tokens to Strings, but MUST NOT process them differently based on the
   received type.

   Media types do not exactly map to Tokens, for instance they allow a
   leading digit.  In cases like these, the String format needs to be
   used.

   The only supported uses of wildcards are "*/*", which matches any
   type, or "xxxx/*", which matches any subtype of the indicated type.

   The order of types listed in the field value is not significant.

   The value of the Accept-Query field applies to every URI on the
   server that shares the same path; in other words, the query component
   is ignored.  If requests to the same resource return different
   Accept-Query values, the most recently received fresh value (per
   Section 4.2 of [HTTP-CACHING]) is used.

   Example:

   Accept-Query: "application/jsonpath", application/sql;charset="UTF-8"

   Although the syntax for this field appears to be similar to other
   fields, such as "Accept" (Section 12.5.1 of [HTTP]), it is a
   Structured Field and thus MUST be processed as specified in Section 4
   of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

4.  Security Considerations

   The QUERY method is subject to the same general security
   considerations as all HTTP methods as described in [HTTP].

   It can be used as an alternative to passing request information in
   the URI (e.g., in the query component).  This is preferred in some
   cases, as the URI is more likely to be logged or otherwise processed
   by intermediaries than the request content.  In other cases, where
   the query contains sensitive information, the potential for logging
   of the URI might motivate the use of QUERY over GET.

   If a server creates a temporary resource to represent the results of
   a QUERY request (e.g., for use in the Location or Content-Location
   field) and the request contains sensitive information that cannot be
   logged, then the URI of this resource SHOULD be chosen such that it
   does not include any sensitive portions of the original request
   content.

   Caches that normalize QUERY content incorrectly or in ways that are
   significantly different from how the resource processes the content
   can return an incorrect response if normalization results in a false
   positive.

   A QUERY request from user agents implementing CORS (Cross-Origin
   Resource Sharing) will require a "preflight" request, as QUERY does
   not belong to the set of CORS-safelisted methods (see "Methods
   (https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#methods)" in [FETCH]).

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of QUERY method

   IANA is requested to add the QUERY method to the HTTP Method Registry
   at <http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods> (see Section 16.3.1
   of [HTTP]).

            +=============+======+============+===============+
            | Method Name | Safe | Idempotent | Specification |
            +=============+======+============+===============+
            | QUERY       | Yes  | Yes        | Section 2     |
            +-------------+------+------------+---------------+

                                  Table 2

5.2.  Registration of Accept-Query field

   IANA is requested to add the Accept-Query field to the HTTP Field
   Name Registry at <https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-fields> (see
   Section 16.1.1 of [HTTP]).

   +==============+===========+============+================+==========+

Appendix A.  Examples

   The examples below are for illustrative purposes only; if one needs
   to send queries that are actually this short, it is likely better to
   use GET.

   The media type used in most examples is "application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded" (as used in POST requests from browser user clients,
   defined in "application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   (https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#application/x-www-form-urlencoded)" in
   [URL]).  The Content-Length fields have been omitted for brevity.

A.1.  Simple Query

   A simple query with a direct response:

   QUERY /contacts HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Accept: application/json

   select=surname,givenname,email&limit=10&match=%22email=*@example.*%22

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json

   [
     { "surname": "Smith",
       "givenname": "John",
       "email": "smith@example.org" },
     { "surname": "Jones",
       "givenname": "Sally",
       "email": "sally.jones@example.com" },
     { "surname": "Dubois",
       "givenname": "Camille",
       "email": "camille.dubois@example.net" }
   ]

A.2.  Discovery of QUERY support

   A simple way to discover support for QUERY is provided by the OPTIONS
   (Section 9.3.7 of [HTTP]) method:

   OPTIONS /contacts HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Allow: GET, QUERY, OPTIONS, HEAD

   The Allow response field (Section 10.2.1 of [HTTP]) denotes the set
   of supported methods on the specified resource.

   There are alternatives to the use of OPTIONS.  For instance, a QUERY
   request can be tried without prior knowledge of server support.  The
   server would then either process the request, or could respond with a
   4xx status such as 405 (Method Not Allowed, Section 15.5.6 of
   [HTTP]), including the Allow response field.

A.3.  Discovery of QUERY Formats

   Discovery of supported media types for QUERY is possible via the
   Accept-Query (Section 3) response field:

   HEAD /contacts HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/xhtml
   Accept-Query: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/sql

   Responses to which request methods will contain Accept-Query will
   depend on the resource being accessed.

   An alternative to checking Accept-Query would be to make a QUERY
   request, and then -- in case of a 4xx status such as 415 (Unsupported
   Media Type, Section 15.5.16 of [HTTP]) response -- to inspect the
   Accept (Section 12.5.1 of [HTTP]) response field:

   HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
   Content-Type: application/xhtml
   Accept: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/sql

A.4.  Content-Location, Location, and Indirect Responses

   As described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the Content-Location and
   Location response fields in success responses (2xx, Section 15.3 of
   [HTTP]) provide a way to identify alternate resources that will
   respond to GET requests, either for the received result of the
   request, or for future requests to perform the same operation.  Going
   back to the example from Appendix A.1:

   QUERY /contacts HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Accept: application/json

   select=surname,givenname,email&limit=10&match=%22email=*@example.*%22

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Content-Location: /contacts/stored-results/17
   Location: /contacts/stored-queries/42
   Last-Modified: Sat, 25 Aug 2012 23:34:45 GMT
   Date: Sun, 17 Nov 2024, 16:10:24 GMT

   [
     { "surname": "Smith",
       "givenname": "John",
       "email": "smith@example.org" },
     { "surname": "Jones",
       "givenname": "Sally",
       "email": "sally.jones@example.com" },
     { "surname": "Dubois",
       "givenname": "Camille",
       "email": "camille.dubois@example.net" }
   ]

A.4.1.  Using Content-Location

   The Content-Location response field received above identifies a
   resource holding the result for the QUERY response it appeared on:

   GET /contacts/stored-results/17 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept: application/json

   Response:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Last-Modified: Sat, 25 Aug 2012 23:34:45 GMT
   Date: Sun, 17 Nov 2024, 16:10:25 GMT

   [
     { "surname": "Smith",
       "givenname": "John",
       "email": "smith@example.org" },
     { "surname": "Jones",
       "givenname": "Sally",
       "email": "sally.jones@example.com" },
     { "surname": "Dubois",
       "givenname": "Camille",
       "email": "camille.dubois@example.net" }
   ]

   Note that there's no guarantee that the server will implement this
   resource indefinitely, so, after an error response, the client would
   need to redo the original QUERY request in order to obtain a new
   alternative location.

A.4.2.  Using Location

   The Location response field identifies a resource that will respond
   to GET with a current result for the same process and parameters as
   the original QUERY request.

   GET /contacts/stored-queries/42 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept: application/json

   In this example, one entry was removed at 2024-11-17T16:12:01Z (as
   indicated in the Last-Modified field), so the response only contains
   two entries:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Last-Modified: Sun, 17 November 2024, 16:12:01 GMT
   ETag: "42-1"
   Date: Sun, 17 Nov 2024, 16:13:17 GMT

   [
     { "surname": "Smith",
       "givenname": "John",
       "email": "smith@example.org" },
     { "surname": "Dubois",
       "givenname": "Camille",
       "email": "camille.dubois@example.net" }
   ]

   Assuming that the server still exposes the resource and that there
   was no change in the query result, a subsequent conditional GET
   request with

   If-None-Match: "42-1"

   would result in a 304 response (Not Modified, Section 15.4.5 of
   [HTTP]).

A.4.3.  Indirect Responses

   Servers can send "indirect" responses (Section 2.3) using the status
   code 303 (See Other, Section 15.4.4 of [HTTP]).

   Given the request at the beginning of Appendix A.4, a server might
   respond with:

   HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
   Content-Type: text/plain
   Date: Sun, 17 Nov 2024, 16:13:17 GMT
   Location: /contacts/stored-queries/42

   See stored query at "/contacts/stored-queries/42".

   This is similar to including Location on a direct response, except
   that no result for the query is returned.  This allows the server to
   only generate or reuse an alternative resource.  This resource could
   then be used as shown in Appendix A.4.2.

A.5.  More Query Formats

   The following examples show requests on a JSON-shaped ([RFC8259])
   database of RFC errata.

   The request below uses XSLT ([XSLT]) to extract errata information
   summarized per year and the defined errata types.

   QUERY /errata.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/xslt+xml
   Accept: application/xml, text/csv

   <transform xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
     xmlns:j="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions"

     <param name="input"/>

     <variable name="json"
       select="json-to-xml(unparsed-text($input))"/>

     <template match="/">

       <for-each-group select="$en"
         group-by="substring-before(j:string[@key=$sd],'-')">
         <sort select="current-grouping-key()"/>
         <variable name="year" select="current-grouping-key()"/>
         <variable name="errata" select=
           "$en[$year=substring-before(j:string[@key=$sd],'-')]"/>
         <value-of select="concat(
           $year,
           ', ',
           count($errata),
           ', ',
           count($errata['Rejected'=j:string[@key=$sc]]),
           ', ',
           count($errata['Verified'=j:string[@key=$sc]]),
           ', ',
           count(
             $errata['Held for Document Update'=j:string[@key=$sc]]),
           ', ',
           count($errata['Reported'=j:string[@key=$sc]]),
           '&#10;')"/>
       </for-each-group>
     </template>

   </transform>

   Note the Accept-Query response field indicating that another query
   format -- JSONPath ([RFC9535]) -- is supported as well.  The request
   below would report the identifiers of all rejected errata submitted
   since 2024:

   QUERY /errata.json HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Content-Type: application/jsonpath
   Accept: application/json

   $..[
        ?@.errata_status_code=="Rejected"
