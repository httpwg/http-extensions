<section title="Introduction" anchor="introduction">
<t>
  Defining syntax for new HTTP header fields (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="," 
  x:rel="#header.fields"/>) is non-trivial. Among the commonly encountered
  problems are:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>There is no common syntax for complex field values. Several well-known 
    header fields do use a similarly looking syntax, but it is hard to write
    generic parsing code that will both correctly handle valid field values
    but also reject invalid ones.
    </t>
    <t>The HTTP message format allows header fields to repeat, so field syntax
    needs to be designed in a way that these cases are either meaningful,
    or can be unambiguously detected and rejected.
    </t>
    <t>HTTP/1.1 does not define a character encoding scheme (<xref target="RFC6365"
    x:fmt="," x:sec="2"/>), so header fields are either stuck with US-ASCII
    (<xref target="RFC0020"/>), or need out-of-band information
    to decide what encoding scheme is used. Furthermore, APIs
    usually assume a default encoding scheme in order to map from
    octet sequences to strings (for instance, <xref target="XMLHttpRequest"/>
    uses the IDL type "ByteString", effectively resulting in the
    ISO-8859-1 character encoding scheme <xref target="ISO-8859-1"/> being used).
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  (See <xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#considerations.for.new.header.fields"/>
  for a summary of considerations for new header fields.)
</t>
<t>
  This specification addresses the issues listed above by defining both a generic
  JSON-based (<xref target="RFC7159"/>) data model and a concrete
  wire format that can be used in definitions of new header fields, where the
  goals were:
</t>
<ul>
  <li>to be compatible with header field recombination when fields occur multiple
  times in a single message (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.order"/>), and</li>
  <li>not to use any problematic characters in the field value (non-ASCII characters and certain whitespace characters).</li>
</ul>
</section>  

<!--<section title="Notational Conventions" anchor="notational.conventions">
<t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
   This document reuses terminology used in the base HTTP specifications,
   namely <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#header.fields"/>.
</t>
</section>-->

<section title="Data Model and Format">
<t>
  In HTTP, header fields with the same field name can occur multiple times
  within a single message (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.order"/>).
  When this happens, recipients are allowed to combine the field values using  
  commas as delimiter. This rule matches nicely JSON's array format 
  (<xref target="RFC7159" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#arrays"/>). Thus, the basic data model
  used here is the JSON array.
</t>
<t>
  Header field definitions that need only a single value can restrict
  themselves to arrays of length 1, and are encouraged to define error
  handling in case more values are received (such as "first wins", "last wins",
  or "abort with fatal error message").
</t>
<t>
  JSON arrays are mapped to field values by creating a sequence of
  serialized member elements, separated by commas and optionally whitespace. This
  is equivalent to using the full JSON array format, while leaving out
  the "begin-array" ('[') and "end-array" (']') delimiters.
</t>
<figure>
<preamble>
  The ABNF character names and classes below are used (copied
  from <xref target="RFC5234" x:fmt="," x:sec="B.1"/>):
</preamble>
<artwork type="abnf2616">
  CR               = %x0D    ; carriage return
  HTAB             = %x09    ; horizontal tab
  LF               = %x0A    ; line feed
  SP               = %x20    ; space
  VCHAR            = %x21-7E ; visible (printing) characters
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  Characters in JSON strings that are not allowed or discouraged in HTTP
  header field values &mdash; that is, not in the "VCHAR" definition &mdash;
  need to be represented using JSON's "backslash" escaping mechanism
  (<xref target="RFC7159" x:fmt="," x:rel="#strings"/>).
</t>
<t>
  The control characters CR, LF, and HTAB do not appear inside JSON
  strings, but can be used outside (line breaks, indentation etc.). These characters
  need to be either stripped or replaced by space characters (ABNF "SP").
</t>
<t>
  Formally, using the HTTP specification's ABNF extensions defined in
  <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#abnf.extension"/>:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
  json-field-value = #json-field-item
  json-field-item  = JSON-Text
                   ; see <xref target="RFC7159" x:fmt="," x:rel="#grammar"/>,
                   ; post-processed so that only VCHAR characters
                   ; are used
</artwork></figure>
</section>

<section title="Sender Requirements">
<t>
  To map a JSON array to an HTTP header field value, process each array
  element separately by:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>generating the JSON representation,</t>
    <t>stripping all JSON control characters (CR, HTAB, LF), or replacing
      them by space ("SP") characters,</t>
    <t>replacing all remaining non-VSPACE characters by the equivalent
    backslash-escape sequence (<xref target="RFC7159" x:fmt="," x:rel="#strings"/>).</t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  The resulting list of strings is transformed into an HTTP field value
  by combining them using comma (%x2C) plus optional SP as delimiter,
  and encoding the resulting string into an octet sequence using the 
  US-ASCII character encoding scheme (<xref target="RFC0020"/>).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Recipient Requirements">
<t>
  To map a set of HTTP header field instances to a JSON array:
  <list style="numbers">
    <t>combine all header field instances into a single field as per
    <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.order"/>,</t>
    <t>add a leading begin-array ("[") octet and a trailing end-array ("]") octet, then</t>
    <t>run the resulting octet sequence through a JSON parser.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  The result of the parsing operation is either an error (in which case
  the header field values needs to be considered invalid), or a JSON array.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Using this Format in Header Field Definitions">
<t>
  <cref>Explain what a definition of a new header field needs to do precisely
  to use this format, mention must-ignore extensibility</cref>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Examples" anchor="examples">
<t>
  This section shows how some of the existing HTTP header fields would look
  like if they would use the format defined by this specification.
</t>
<section title="Content-Length" anchor="example.content-length">
<t>
  "Content-Length" is defined in <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of"
  x:rel="#header.content-length"/>, with the field value's ABNF being:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
  Content-Length = 1*DIGIT
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  So the field value is similar to a JSON number (<xref target="RFC7159"
  x:fmt="," x:rel="#numbers"/>).
</t>
<t>
  Content-Length is restricted to a single field instance, as it doesn't use
  the list production (as per <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.order"/>).
  However, in practice multiple instances do occur, and the definition of
  the header field does indeed discuss how to handle these cases.
</t>
<t>
  If Content-Length was defined using the JSON format discussed here, the
  ABNF would be something like:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
  Content-Length = #number
                 ; number: <xref target="RFC7159" x:fmt="," x:rel="#numbers"/>
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  ...and the prose definition would:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>restrict all numbers to be non-negative integers without fractions, and</t>
    <t>require that the array of values is of length 1
    (but allow the case where the array is longer, but all members represent
    the same value)</t>
  </list>
</t>
</section>
<section title="Content-Disposition" anchor="example.content-disposition">
<t>
  Content-Disposition field values, defined in <xref target="RFC6266"/>, consist of
  a "disposition type" (a string), plus multiple parameters, of which at least
  one ("filename") sometime needs to carry non-ASCII characters.
</t>
<t>
  For instance, the first example in <xref target="RFC6266" x:fmt="of" x:sec="5"/>:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Attachment; filename=example.html
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  has a disposition type of "Attachment", with filename parameter value
  "example.html". A JSON representation of this information might be:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="application/json" x:lang="">
  {
    "Attachment": {
      "filename" : "example.html"
    }
  }
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  which would translate to a header field value of:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="application/json" x:lang="">
  { "Attachment": { "filename" : "example.html" } }
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  The third example in <xref target="RFC6266" x:fmt="of" x:sec="5"/>
  uses a filename parameter containing non-US-ASCII characters:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  attachment; filename*=UTF-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  Note that in this case, the "filename*" parameter uses the encoding defined in
  <xref target="RFC5987"/>, representing a filename starting with the Unicode
  character U+20AC (EURO SIGN), followed by " rates". If the definition
  of Content-Disposition would have used the format proposed here, the
  workaround involving the "parameter*" syntax would not have been needed at 
  all.
</t>
<t>
  The JSON representation of this value could then be:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="application/json" x:lang="">
  { "attachment": { "filename" : "\u20AC rates" } }
</artwork></figure>
</section>
<section title="WWW-Authenticate" anchor="example.www-authenticate">
<t>
  The WWW-Authenticate header field value is defined in <xref target="RFC7235" x:fmt="of"
  x:rel="#header.www-authenticate"/> as a list of "challenges":
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
   WWW-Authenticate = 1#challenge
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  ...where a challenge consists of a scheme with optional parameters:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
  challenge   = auth-scheme [ 1*SP ( token68 / #auth-param ) ]
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  An example for a complex header field value given in the definition of
  the header field is:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  Newauth realm="apps", type=1, title="Login to \"apps\"",
  Basic realm="simple"
</artwork>
<postamble>(line break added for readability)</postamble>
</figure>
<t>
  A possible JSON representation of this field value would be the array below:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="application/json" x:lang="">
  [
    {
      "Newauth" : {
        "realm": "apps",
        "type" : 1,
        "title" : "Login to \"apps\""
      }
    },
    {
      "Basic" : {
        "realm": "simple"
      }
    } 
  ]
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  ...which would translate to a header field value of:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  { "Newauth" : { "realm": "apps", "type" : 1,
                  "title": "Login to \"apps\"" }},
  { "Basic" : { "realm": "simple"}}
</artwork></figure>
</section>
<section title="Accept-Encoding" anchor="example.accept-encoding">
<t>
  The Accept-Encoding header field value is defined in <xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="of"
  x:rel="#header.accept-encoding"/> as a list of codings, each of which
  allowing a weight parameter 'q':
</t>
<figure><artwork type="abnf2616">
   Accept-Encoding = #( codings [ weight ] )
   codings         = content-coding / "identity" / "*"
   weight          = OWS ";" OWS "q=" qvalue
   qvalue          = ( "0" [ "." 0*3DIGIT ] )
                   / ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  An example for a complex header field value given in the definition of
  the header field is:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  Due to the defaulting rules for the quality value (<xref target="RFC7231" x:fmt="," x:rel="#quality.values"/>),
  this could also be written as:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  gzip, identity; q=0.5, *; q=0
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  A JSON representation could be:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="application/json" x:lang="">
  [
    {
      "gzip" : {
      }
    },
    {
      "identity" : {
        "q": 0.5
      }
    },
    {
      "*" : {
        "q": 0
      }
    }
  ]
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  ...which would translate to a header field value of:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  {"gzip": {}}, {"identity": {"q": 0.5}}, {"*": {"q": 0}}
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  In this example, the part about "gzip" appears unnecessarily verbose, as
  the value is just an empty object. A simpler notation would collapse
  members like these to string literals:
</t>
<figure><artwork type="example">
  "gzip", {"identity": {"q": 0.5}}, {"*": {"q": 0}}
</artwork></figure>
<t>
  If this is desirable, the header field definition could allow both
  string literals and objects, and define that a mere string literal
  would be mapped to a member whose name is given by the string literal,
  and the value is an empty object.  
</t>
<figure>
<preamble>
  For what it's worth, one of the most common cases for 'Accept-Encoding' would
  become:
</preamble>
<artwork type="example">
  "gzip", "deflate"
</artwork>
<postamble>
  which would be only a small overhead over the original format.
</postamble>
</figure>
</section>
</section>

<section title="Discussion">
<t>
  This approach uses a default of "JSON array", using implicit array markers.
  An alternative would be a default of "JSON object". This would simplify
  the syntax for non-list-typed header fields, but all the benefits of having the
  same data model for both types of header fields would be gone.  
  A hybrid approach might make sense, as long as it doesn't require any
  heuristics on the recipient's side.
</t>
<aside>
  <t>
    <x:h>Note:</x:h>
    a concrete proposal was made by Kazuho Oku in
    <eref target="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JanMar/0155.html"/>.

</aside>
<t>
  <cref>Use of generic libs vs compactness of field values..</cref>
</t>
<t>
  <cref>Mention potential "Key" header field extension (<xref target="KEY"/>).</cref>
</t>
</section>

<section title="Deployment Considerations">
<t>
  This JSON-based syntax will only apply to newly introduced
  header fields, thus backwards compatibility is not a problem. That being
  said, it is conceivable that there is existing code that might trip over
  double quotes not being used for HTTP's quoted-string syntax (<xref target="RFC7230" x:rel="#field.components"/>).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Internationalization Considerations">
<t>
  In HTTP/1.1, header field values are represented by octet sequences, usually used to
  transmit ASCII characters, with restrictions on the use of certain
  control characters, and no associated default character encoding, nor
  a way to describe it (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="," x:rel="#header.fields"/>).
  HTTP/2 does not change this.
</t>
<t>
  This specification maps all characters which can cause problems to JSON
  escape sequences, thereby solving the HTTP header field
  internationalization problem.
</t>
<t>
  Future specifications of HTTP might change to allow non-ASCII characters
  natively. In that case, header fields using the syntax defined by this
  specification would have a simple migration path (by just stopping
  to require escaping of non-ASCII characters). 
</t>
</section>

<section title="Security Considerations">
<t>
  Using JSON-shaped field values is believed to not introduce any new threads
  beyond those described in <xref target="RFC7159" x:sec="12"/>, namely
  the risk of recipients using the wrong tools to parse them.
</t>
<t>
  Other than that, any syntax that makes extensions easy can be used to
  smuggle information through field values; however, this concern is shared
  with other widely used formats, such as those using parameters in the
  form of name/value pairs.
