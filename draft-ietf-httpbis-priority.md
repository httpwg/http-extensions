--- abstract

This document describes a scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses. This scheme
expresses the priority of each HTTP response using absolute values, rather than
as a relative relationship between a group of HTTP responses.

This document defines the Priority header field for communicating the initial
priority in an HTTP version-independent manner, as well as HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
frames for reprioritizing the responses. These share a common format structure
that is designed to provide future extensibility.

# Introduction

It is common for an HTTP ({{!RFC7230}}) resource representation to have
relationships to one or more other resources.  Clients will often discover these
relationships while processing a retrieved representation, leading to further
retrieval requests.  Meanwhile, the nature of the relationship determines
whether the client is blocked from continuing to process locally available
resources.  For example, visual rendering of an HTML document could be blocked
by the retrieval of a CSS file that the document refers to.  In contrast, inline
images do not block rendering and get drawn incrementally as the chunks of the
images arrive.

To provide meaningful presentation of a document at the earliest moment, it is
important for an HTTP server to prioritize the HTTP responses, or the chunks of
those HTTP responses, that it sends.

RFC 7540 {{?RFC7540}} stream priority allowed a client to send a series of
priority signals that communicate to the server a "priority tree"; the structure
of this tree represents the client's preferred relative ordering and weighted
distribution of the bandwidth among HTTP responses. Servers could use these
priority signals as input into prioritization decision making.

The design and implementation of RFC 7540 stream priority was observed to have
shortcomings, explained in {{motivation}}.
({{!HTTP2=I-D.ietf-httpbis-http2bis}}) has consequently deprecated the use of
these stream priority signals.

This document describes an extensible scheme for prioritizing HTTP responses
that uses absolute values. {{parameters}} defines priority parameters, which are
a standardized and extensible format of priority information. {{header-field}}
defines the Priority HTTP header field that can be used by both client and
server to exchange parameters in order to specify the precedence of HTTP
responses in a protocol-version-independent and end-to-end manner.
{{h2-update-frame}} and {{h3-update-frame}} define version-specific frames that
carry parameters for reprioritization. This prioritization scheme and its
signals can act as a substitute for RFC 7540 stream priority.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.

The terms sf-integer and sf-boolean are imported from
{{!STRUCTURED-FIELDS=RFC8941}}.

Example HTTP requests and responses use the HTTP/2-style formatting from
{{HTTP2}}.

This document uses the variable-length integer encoding from
{{!QUIC=RFC9000}}.

The term control stream is used to describe the HTTP/2 stream with identifier
0x0, and HTTP/3 control stream; see {{Section 6.2.1 of !HTTP3=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.

The term HTTP/2 priority signal is used to describe the priority information
sent from clients to servers in HTTP/2 frames; see {{Section 5.3.2 of HTTP2}}.


# Motivation for Replacing RFC 7540 Priorities {#motivation}

An important feature of any implementation of a protocol that provides
multiplexing is the ability to prioritize the sending of information.
Prioritization is a difficult problem, so it will always be suboptimal,
particularly if one endpoint operates in ignorance of the needs of its peer.
Priority signalling allows endpoints to communicate their own view of priority
needs, which can be combined with other factors that are considered during the
peer's prioritization decision making.

RFC 7540 stream priority ({{Section 5.3 of ?RFC7540}}) is a complex system where
clients signal stream dependencies and weights to describe an unbalanced tree.
It suffered from poor deployment and interoperability and was deprecated in a
revision of HTTP/2 ({{HTTP2}}). However, in order to maintain wire
compatibility, HTTP/2 priority signals are still mandatory to handle (see
{{Section 5.3.2 of HTTP2}}).

Clients can build RFC 7540 trees with rich flexibility but experience has shown
this is rarely exercised. Instead they tend to choose a single model optimized
for a single use case and experiment within the model constraints, or do nothing
at all. Furthermore, many clients build their prioritization tree in a unique
way, which makes it difficult for servers to understand their intent and act or
intervene accordingly.

Many RFC 7540 server implementations do not act on HTTP/2 priority signals. Some
instead favor custom server-driven schemes based on heuristics or other hints,
such as resource content type or request generation order. For example, a
server, with knowledge of the document structure, might want to prioritize the
delivery of images that are critical to user experience above other images, but
below the CSS files. Since client trees vary, it is impossible for the server to
determine how such images should be prioritized against other responses.

RFC 7540 allows intermediaries to coalesce multiple client trees into a single
tree that is used for a single upstream HTTP/2 connection. However, most
intermediaries do not support this. Additionally, RFC 7540 does not define a
method that can be used by a server to express the priority of a response.
Without such a method, intermediaries cannot coordinate client-driven and
server-driven priorities.

RFC 7540 describes denial-of-service considerations for implementations. On
2019-08-13 Netflix issued an advisory notice about the discovery of several
resource exhaustion vectors affecting multiple RFC 7540 implementations. One
attack, [CVE-2019-9513] aka "Resource Loop", is based on using priority signals
to manipulate the server's stored prioritization state.

HTTP/2 priority signals are required to be delivered and processed in the order
they are sent so that the receiver handling is deterministic. Porting HTTP/2
priority signals to protocols that do not provide ordering guarantees presents
challenges. For example, HTTP/3 {{HTTP3}} lacks global ordering across streams
that would carry priority signals. Early attempts to port HTTP/2 priority
signals to HTTP/3 required adding additional information to the signals, leading
to more complicated processing. Problems found with this approach could not be
resolved and definition of a HTTP/3 priority signalling feature was removed
before publication.

Considering the problems with the deployment of RFC 7540 stream priority, and
the difficulties in adapting it to HTTP/3, continuing to base prioritization on
this mechanism risks increasing the complexity of systems. Multiple experiments
from independent research have shown that simpler schemes can reach at least
equivalent performance characteristics compared to the more complex RFC 7540
setups seen in practice, at least for the web use case.

## Disabling RFC 7540 Priorities {#disabling}

The problems and insights set out above provided the motivation for deprecating
RFC 7540 stream priority (see {{Section 5.3 of RFC7540}}).

The SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_RFC7540_PRIORITIES setting is defined by this document in
order to allow endpoints to explicitly opt out of using HTTP/2 priority signals
(see {{Section 5.3.2 of HTTP2}}). Endpoints are expected to use an alternative,
such as the scheme defined in this specification.

The value of SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_RFC7540_PRIORITIES MUST be 0 or 1. Any value
other than 0 or 1 MUST be treated as a connection error (see {{Section 5.4.1 of
HTTP2}}) of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

Endpoints MUST send this SETTINGS parameter as part of the first SETTINGS frame.
A sender MUST NOT change the SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_RFC7540_PRIORITIES parameter value
after the first SETTINGS frame. Detection of a change by a receiver MUST be
treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

Until the client receives the SETTINGS frame from the server, the client SHOULD
send both the HTTP/2 priority signals and the signals of this prioritization
scheme (see {{header-field}} and {{h2-update-frame}}). When the client receives
the first SETTINGS frame that contains the SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_RFC7540_PRIORITIES
parameter with value of 1, it SHOULD stop sending the HTTP/2 priority signals.
If the value was 0 or if the settings parameter was absent, it SHOULD stop
sending PRIORITY_UPDATE frames ({{h2-update-frame}}), but MAY continue sending
the Priority header field ({{header-field}}), as it is an end-to-end signal that
might be useful to nodes behind the server that the client is directly connected
to.

The SETTINGS frame precedes any HTTP/2 priority signal sent from a client, so a
server can determine if it needs to allocate any resource to signal handling
before they arrive. A server that receives SETTINGS_DEPRECATE_RFC7540_PRIORITIES
with value of 1 MUST ignore HTTP/2 priority signals.

Where both endpoints disable RFC 7540 stream priority, the client is expected to
send this scheme's priority signal. Handling of omitted signals is described in
{{parameters}}.

# Applicability of the Extensible Priority Scheme

The priority scheme defined by this document considers only the prioritization
of HTTP messages and tunnels, see {{client-scheduling}}, {{server-scheduling}},
and {{connect-scheduling}}.

Where HTTP extensions change stream behavior or define new data carriage
mechanisms, they can also define how this priority scheme can be applied.


# Priority Parameters {#parameters}

The priority information is a sequence of key-value pairs, providing room for
future extensions. Each key-value pair represents a priority parameter.

The Priority HTTP header field ({{header-field}}) is an end-to-end way to
transmit this set of parameters when a request or a response is issued. In order
to reprioritize a request, HTTP-version-specific frames ({{h2-update-frame}} and
{{h3-update-frame}}) are used by clients to transmit the same information on a
single hop.  If intermediaries want to specify prioritization on a multiplexed
HTTP connection, they SHOULD use a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame and SHOULD NOT change
the Priority header field.

In both cases, the set of priority parameters is encoded as a Structured Fields
Dictionary ({{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}).

This document defines the urgency(`u`) and incremental(`i`) parameters. When
receiving an HTTP request that does not carry these priority parameters, a
server SHOULD act as if their default values were specified. Note that handling
of omitted parameters is different when processing an HTTP response; see
{{merging}}.

Unknown parameters, parameters with out-of-range values or values of unexpected
types MUST be ignored.

## Urgency

The urgency parameter (`u`) takes an integer between 0 and 7, in descending
order of priority. This range provides sufficient granularity for prioritizing
responses for ordinary web browsing, at minimal complexity.

The value is encoded as an sf-integer. The default value is 3.

This parameter indicates the sender's recommendation, based on the expectation
that the server would transmit HTTP responses in the order of their urgency
values if possible. The smaller the value, the higher the precedence.

The following example shows a request for a CSS file with the urgency set to
`0`:

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /style.css
priority = u=0
~~~

A client that fetches a document that likely consists of multiple HTTP resources
(e.g., HTML) SHOULD assign the default urgency level to the main resource.  This
convention allows servers to refine the urgency using
knowledge specific to the web-site (see {{merging}}).

The lowest urgency level (7) is reserved for background tasks such as delivery
of software updates. This urgency level SHOULD NOT be used for fetching
responses that have impact on user interaction.

## Incremental

The incremental parameter (`i`) takes an sf-boolean as the value that indicates
if an HTTP response can be processed incrementally, i.e. provide some
meaningful output as chunks of the response arrive.

The default value of the incremental parameter is false (`0`).

A server might distribute the bandwidth of a connection between incremental
responses that share the same urgency, hoping that providing those responses in
parallel would be more helpful to the client than delivering the responses one
by one.

If a client makes concurrent requests with the incremental parameter set to
false, there is no benefit serving responses in parallel because the client is
not going to process those responses incrementally. Serving non-incremental
responses one by one, in the order in which those requests were generated is
considered to be the best strategy.

The following example shows a request for a JPEG file with the urgency parameter
set to `5` and the incremental parameter set to `true`.

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /image.jpg
priority = u=5, i
~~~

## Defining New Parameters {#new-parameters}

When attempting to define new parameters, care must be taken so that they do not
adversely interfere with prioritization performed by existing endpoints or
intermediaries that do not understand the newly defined parameter. Since unknown
parameters are ignored, new parameters should not change the interpretation of
or modify the predefined parameters in a way that is not backwards compatible or
fallback safe.

For example, if there is a need to provide more granularity than eight urgency
levels, it would be possible to subdivide the range using an additional
parameter. Implementations that do not recognize the parameter can safely
continue to use the less granular eight levels.

Alternatively, the urgency can be augmented. For example, a graphical user agent
could send a `visible` parameter to indicate if the resource being requested is
within the viewport.

Generic parameters are preferred over vendor-specific, application-specific or
deployment-specific values. If a generic value cannot be agreed upon in the
community, the parameter's name should be correspondingly specific (e.g., with
a prefix that identifies the vendor, application or deployment).

### Registration {#register}

New Priority parameters can be defined by registering them in the HTTP Priority
Parameters Registry.

Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated Expert, as per
{{Section 4.5 of !RFC8126}}. A specification document is appreciated, but not
required.

The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating requests:

* Community feedback
* If the parameters are sufficiently well-defined and adhere to the guidance
  provided in {{new-parameters}}.

Registration requests should use the following template:

* Name: \[a name for the Priority Parameter that matches key\]
* Description: \[a description of the parameter semantics and value\]
* Reference: \[to a specification defining this parameter\]

See the registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-priority> for details on
where to send registration requests.

# The Priority HTTP Header Field {#header-field}

The Priority HTTP header field can appear in requests and responses. A client
uses it to specify the priority of the response. A server uses it to inform
the client that the priority was overwritten. An intermediary can use the
Priority information from client requests and server responses to correct or
amend the precedence to suit it (see {{merging}}).

The Priority header field is an end-to-end signal of the request priority from
the client or the response priority from the server.

As is the ordinary case for HTTP caching ({{?RFC7234}}), a response with a
Priority header field might be cached and re-used for subsequent requests.
When an origin server generates the Priority response header field based on
properties of an HTTP request it receives, the server is expected to control the
cacheability or the applicability of the cached response, by using header fields
that control the caching behavior (e.g., Cache-Control, Vary).

An endpoint that fails to parse the Priority header field SHOULD use default
parameter values.


# Reprioritization

After a client sends a request, it may be beneficial to change the priority of
the response. As an example, a web browser might issue a prefetch request for a
JavaScript file with the urgency parameter of the Priority request header field
set to `u=7` (background). Then, when the user navigates to a page which
references the new JavaScript file, while the prefetch is in progress, the
browser would send a reprioritization signal with the priority field value set
to `u=0`. The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame ({{frame}}) can be used for such
reprioritization.


# The PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame {#frame}

This document specifies a new PRIORITY_UPDATE frame for HTTP/2 ({{HTTP2}})
and HTTP/3 ({{HTTP3}}). It carries priority parameters and
references the target of the prioritization based on a version-specific
identifier. In HTTP/2, this identifier is the Stream ID; in HTTP/3, the
identifier is either the Stream ID or Push ID. Unlike the Priority header field,
the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame is a hop-by-hop signal.

PRIORITY_UPDATE frames are sent by clients on the control stream, allowing them
to be sent independent from the stream that carries the response. This means
they can be used to reprioritize a response or a push stream; or signal the
initial priority of a response instead of the Priority header field.

A PRIORITY_UPDATE frame communicates a complete set of all parameters in the
Priority Field Value field. Omitting a parameter is a signal to use the
parameter's default value. Failure to parse the Priority Field Value MUST be
treated as a connection error. In HTTP/2 the error is of type PROTOCOL_ERROR; in
HTTP/3 the error is of type H3_FRAME_ERROR.

A client MAY send a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame before the stream that it references
is open (except for HTTP/2 push streams; see {{h2-update-frame}}). Furthermore,
HTTP/3 offers no guaranteed ordering across streams, which could cause the frame
to be received earlier than intended. Either case leads to a race condition
where a server receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame that references a request stream
that is yet to be opened. To solve this condition, for the purposes of
scheduling, the most recently received PRIORITY_UPDATE frame can be considered
as the most up-to-date information that overrides any other signal. Servers
SHOULD buffer the most recently received PRIORITY_UPDATE frame and apply it once
the referenced stream is opened. Holding PRIORITY_UPDATE frames for each stream
requires server resources, which can can be bound by local implementation
policy. Although there is no limit to the number of PRIORITY_UPDATES that can be
sent, storing only the most recently received frame limits resource commitment.

## HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame {#h2-update-frame}

The HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame (type=0x10) is used by clients to signal the
initial priority of a response, or to reprioritize a response or push stream. It
carries the stream ID of the response and the priority in ASCII text, using the
same representation as the Priority header field value.

The Stream Identifier field ({{Section 5.1.1 of HTTP2}}) in the PRIORITY_UPDATE
frame header MUST be zero (0x0). Receiving a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame with a field
of any other value MUST be treated as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

~~~ drawing
HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame {
  Length (24),
  Type (i) = 10,

  Unused Flags (8).

  Reserved (1),
  Stream Identifier (31),

  Reserved (1),
  Prioritized Stream ID (31),
  Priority Field Value (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-h2-reprioritization-frame title="HTTP/2 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame Payload"}

The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier fields are
described in {{Section 4 of HTTP2}}. The frame payload of PRIORITY_UPDATE
frame payload contains the following additional fields:

Reserved:
: A reserved 1-bit field. The semantics of this bit are undefined, and the bit
  MUST remain unset (0x0) when sending and MUST be ignored when receiving.

Prioritized Stream ID:
: A 31-bit stream identifier for the stream that is the target of the priority
  update.

Priority Field Value:
: The priority update value in ASCII text, encoded using Structured Fields.

When the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame applies to a request stream, clients SHOULD
provide a Prioritized Stream ID that refers to a stream in the "open",
"half-closed (local)", or "idle" state. Servers can discard frames where the
Prioritized Stream ID refers to a stream in the "half-closed (local)" or
"closed" state. The number of streams which have been prioritized but remain in
the "idle" state plus the number of active streams (those in the "open" or
either "half-closed" state; see {{Section 5.1.2 of HTTP2}}) MUST NOT exceed
the value of the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter. Servers that receive
such a PRIORITY_UPDATE MUST respond with a connection error of type
PROTOCOL_ERROR.

When the PRIORITY_UPDATE frame applies to a push stream, clients SHOULD provide
a Prioritized Stream ID that refers to a stream in the "reserved (remote)" or
"half-closed (local)" state. Servers can discard frames where the Prioritized
Stream ID refers to a stream in the "closed" state.
Clients MUST NOT provide a Prioritized Stream ID that refers to a push stream in the
"idle" state. Servers that receive a PRIORITY_UPDATE for a push stream in the "idle" state MUST
respond with a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

If a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame is received with a Prioritized Stream ID of 0x0, the
recipient MUST respond with a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

If a client receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame, it MUST respond with a connection
error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.

## HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame {#h3-update-frame}

The HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE frame (type=0xF0700 or 0xF0701) is used by clients to
signal the initial priority of a response, or to reprioritize a response or push
stream. It carries the identifier of the element that is being prioritized, and
the updated priority in ASCII text, using the same representation as that of the
Priority header field value. PRIORITY_UPDATE with a frame type of 0xF0700 is
used for request streams, while PRIORITY_UPDATE with a frame type of 0xF0701 is
used for push streams.

The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame MUST be sent on the client control stream
({{Section 6.2.1 of HTTP3}}). Receiving a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame on a
stream other than the client control stream MUST be treated as a connection
error of type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.

~~~ drawing
HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame {
  Type (i) = 0xF0700..0xF0701,
  Length (i),
  Prioritized Element ID (i),
  Priority Field Value (..),
}
~~~
{: #fig-h3-reprioritization-frame title="HTTP/3 PRIORITY_UPDATE Frame"}

The PRIORITY_UPDATE frame payload has the following fields:

Prioritized Element ID:
: The stream ID or push ID that is the target of the priority update.

Priority Field Value:
: The priority update value in ASCII text, encoded using Structured Fields.

The request-stream variant of PRIORITY_UPDATE (type=0xF0700) MUST reference a
request stream. If a server receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE (type=0xF0700) for a
Stream ID that is not a request stream, this MUST be treated as a connection
error of type H3_ID_ERROR. The Stream ID MUST be within the client-initiated
bidirectional stream limit. If a server receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE
(type=0xF0700) with a Stream ID that is beyond the stream limits, this SHOULD be
treated as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

The push-stream variant PRIORITY_UPDATE (type=0xF0701) MUST reference a promised
push stream. If a server receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE (type=0xF0701) with a Push ID
that is greater than the maximum Push ID or which has not yet been promised, this
MUST be treated as a connection error of type H3_ID_ERROR.

PRIORITY_UPDATE frames of either type are only sent by clients. If a client
receives a PRIORITY_UPDATE frame, this MUST be treated as a connection error of
type H3_FRAME_UNEXPECTED.


# Merging Client- and Server-Driven Parameters {#merging}

It is not always the case that the client has the best understanding of how the
HTTP responses deserve to be prioritized. The server might have additional
information that can be combined with the client's indicated priority in order
to improve the prioritization of the response. For example, use of an HTML
document might depend heavily on one of the inline images; existence of such
dependencies is typically best known to the server. Or, a server that receives
requests for a font {{?RFC8081}} and images with the same urgency might give
higher precedence to the font, so that a visual client can render textual
information at an early moment.

An origin can use the Priority response header field to indicate its view on how
an HTTP response should be prioritized. An intermediary that forwards an HTTP
response can use the parameters found in the Priority response header field, in
combination with the client Priority request header field, as input to its
prioritization process. No guidance is provided for merging priorities, this is
left as an implementation decision.

Absence of a priority parameter in an HTTP response indicates the server's
disinterest in changing the client-provided value. This is different from the
logic being defined for the request header field, in which omission of a
priority parameter implies the use of their default values (see {{parameters}}).

As a non-normative example, when the client sends an HTTP request with the
urgency parameter set to `5` and the incremental parameter set to `true`

~~~ example
:method = GET
:scheme = https
:authority = example.net
:path = /menu.png
priority = u=5, i
~~~

and the origin responds with

~~~ example
:status = 200
content-type = image/png
priority = u=1
~~~

the intermediary might alter its understanding of the urgency from `5` to `1`,
because it prefers the server-provided value over the client's. The incremental
value continues to be `true`, the value specified by the client, as the server did
not specify the incremental(`i`) parameter.


# Client Scheduling

A client MAY use priority values to make local processing or scheduling choices
about the requests it initiates.


# Server Scheduling

Priority signals are input to a prioritization process. They do not guarantee
any particular processing or transmission order for one response relative to any
other response. An endpoint cannot force a peer to process concurrent request in
a particular order using priority. Expressing priority is therefore only a
suggestion.

A server can use priority signals along with other inputs to make scheduling
decisions. No guidance is provided about how this can or should be done. Factors
such as implementation choices or deployment environment also play a role. Any
given connection is likely to have many dynamic permutations. For these reasons,
there is no unilateral perfect scheduler and this document only provides some
basic recommendations for implementations.

Clients cannot depend on particular treatment based on priority signals. Servers
can use other information to prioritize responses.

It is RECOMMENDED that, when possible, servers respect the urgency parameter
({{urgency}}), sending higher urgency responses before lower urgency responses.

It is RECOMMENDED that, when possible, servers respect the incremental
parameter ({{incremental}}). Non-incremental responses of the same urgency
SHOULD be served one-by-one based on the Stream ID, which corresponds to the
order in which clients make requests. Doing so ensures that clients can use
request ordering to influence response order. Incremental responses of the same
urgency SHOULD be served in round-robin manner.

The incremental parameter indicates how a client processes response bytes as
they arrive. Non-incremental resources are only used when all of the response
payload has been received. Incremental resources are used as parts, or chunks,
of the response payload are received. Therefore, the timing of response data
reception at the client, such as the time to early bytes or the time to receive
the entire payload, plays an important role in perceived performance. Timings
depend on resource size but this scheme provides no explicit guidance about how
a server should use size as an input to prioritization. Instead, the following
examples demonstrate how a server that strictly abides the scheduling guidance
based on urgency and request generation order could find that early requests
prevent serving of later requests.

1. At the same urgency level, a non-incremental request for a large resource
   followed by an incremental request for a small resource.
2. At the same urgency level, an incremental request of indeterminate length
   followed by a non-incremental large resource.

It is RECOMMENDED that servers avoid such starvation where possible. The method
to do so is an implementation decision. For example, a server might
pre-emptively send responses of a particular incremental type based on other
information such as content size.

Optimal scheduling of server push is difficult, especially when pushed resources
contend with active concurrent requests. Servers can consider many factors when
scheduling, such as the type or size of resource being pushed, the priority of
the request that triggered the push, the count of active concurrent responses,
the priority of other active concurrent responses, etc. There is no general
guidance on the best way to apply these. A server that is too simple could
easily push at too high a priority and block client requests, or push at too low
a priority and delay the response, negating intended goals of server push.

Priority signals are a factor for server push scheduling. The concept of
parameter value defaults applies slightly differently because there is no
explicit client-signalled initial priority. A server can apply priority signals
provided in an origin response; see the merging guidance given in {{merging}}.
In the absence of origin signals, applying default parameter values could be
suboptimal. How ever a server decides to schedule a pushed response, it can
signal the intended priority to the client by including the Priority field in
a PUSH_PROMISE or HEADERS frame.

## Intermediaries with Multiple Backend Connections

An intermediary serving an HTTP connection might split requests over multiple
backend connections. When it applies prioritization rules strictly, low priority
requests cannot make progress while requests with higher priorities are inflight. This
blocking can propagate to backend connections, which the peer might interpret as
a connection stall. Endpoints often implement protections against stalls, such
as abruptly closing connections after a certain time period. To reduce the
possibility of this occurring, intermediaries can avoid strictly following
prioritization and instead allocate small amounts of bandwidth for all the
requests that they are forwarding, so that every request can make some progress
over time.

Similarly, servers SHOULD allocate some amount of bandwidths to streams acting
as tunnels.


# Scheduling and the CONNECT Method {#connect-scheduling}

When a request stream carries the CONNECT method, the scheduling guidance in
this document applies to the frames on the stream. A client that issues multiple
CONNECT requests can set the incremental parameter to `true`, servers that
implement the recommendation in {{server-scheduling}} will schedule these
fairly.


# Retransmission Scheduling

Transport protocols such as TCP and QUIC provide reliability by detecting packet
losses and retransmitting lost information. While this document specifies
HTTP-layer prioritization, its effectiveness can be further enhanced if the
transport layer factors priority into scheduling both new data and
retransmission data. The remainder of this section discusses considerations when
using QUIC.

{{Section 13.3 of QUIC}} states "Endpoints SHOULD prioritize
retransmission of data over sending new data, unless priorities specified by the
application indicate otherwise". When an HTTP/3 application uses the priority
scheme defined in this document and the QUIC transport implementation supports
application indicated stream priority, a transport that considers the relative
priority of streams when scheduling both new data and retransmission data might
better match the expectations of the application. However, there are no
requirements on how a transport chooses to schedule based on this information
because the decision depends on several factors and trade-offs. It could
prioritize new data for a higher urgency stream over retransmission data for a
lower priority stream, or it could prioritize retransmission data over new data
irrespective of urgencies.

{{Section 6.2.4 of ?QUIC-RECOVERY=RFC9002}},  also highlights consideration of
application priorities when sending probe packets after PTO timer expiration. An
QUIC implementation supporting application-indicated priorities might use the
relative priority of streams when choosing probe data.


# Fairness {#fairness}

As a general guideline, a server SHOULD NOT use priority information for making
schedule decisions across multiple connections, unless it knows that those
connections originate from the same client. Due to this, priority information
conveyed over a non-coalesced HTTP connection (e.g., HTTP/1.1) might go unused.

The remainder of this section discusses scenarios where unfairness is
problematic and presents possible mitigations, or where unfairness is desirable.

## Coalescing Intermediaries

When an intermediary coalesces HTTP requests coming from multiple clients into
one HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 connection going to the backend server, requests that
originate from one client might have higher precedence than those coming from
others.

It is sometimes beneficial for the server running behind an intermediary to obey
to the value of the Priority header field. As an example, a resource-constrained
server might defer the transmission of software update files that would have the
background urgency being associated. However, in the worst case, the asymmetry
between the precedence declared by multiple clients might cause responses going
to one user agent to be delayed totally after those going to another.

In order to mitigate this fairness problem, a server could use knowledge about
the intermediary as another signal in its prioritization decisions. For
instance, if a server knows the intermediary is coalescing requests, then it
could serve the responses in round-robin manner. This can work if the
constrained resource is network capacity between the intermediary and the user
agent, as the intermediary buffers responses and forwards the chunks based on
the prioritization scheme it implements.

A server can determine if a request came from an intermediary through
configuration, or by consulting if that request contains one of the following
header fields:

* Forwarded, X-Forwarded-For ({{?RFC7239}})
* Via (Section 5.7.1 of {{?RFC7230}})

## HTTP/1.x Back Ends

It is common for CDN infrastructure to support different HTTP versions on the
front end and back end. For instance, the client-facing edge might support
HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 while communication to back end servers is done using
HTTP/1.1. Unlike with connection coalescing, the CDN will "de-mux" requests into
discrete connections to the back end. As HTTP/1.1 and older do not provide a way
to concurrently transmit multiple responses, there is no immediate fairness
issue in protocol. However, back end servers MAY still use client headers for
request scheduling. Back end servers SHOULD only schedule based on client
priority information where that information can be scoped to individual end
clients. Authentication and other session information might provide this
linkability.

## Intentional Introduction of Unfairness

It is sometimes beneficial to deprioritize the transmission of one connection
over others, knowing that doing so introduces a certain amount of unfairness
between the connections and therefore between the requests served on those
connections.

For example, a server might use a scavenging congestion controller on
connections that only convey background priority responses such as software
update images. Doing so improves responsiveness of other connections at the cost
of delaying the delivery of updates.

# Why use an End-to-End Header Field?

Contrary to the prioritization scheme of HTTP/2 that uses a hop-by-hop frame,
the Priority header field is defined as end-to-end.

The rationale is that the Priority header field transmits how each response
affects the client's processing of those responses, rather than how relatively
urgent each response is to others.  The way a client processes a response is a
property associated to that client generating that request.  Not that of an
intermediary.  Therefore, it is an end-to-end property.  How these end-to-end
properties carried by the Priority header field affect the prioritization
between the responses that share a connection is a hop-by-hop issue.

Having the Priority header field defined as end-to-end is important for caching
intermediaries.  Such intermediaries can cache the value of the Priority header
field along with the response, and utilize the value of the cached header field
when serving the cached response, only because the header field is defined as
end-to-end rather than hop-by-hop.

It should also be noted that the use of a header field carrying a textual value
makes the prioritization scheme extensible; see the discussion below.

# Security Considerations

[CVE-2019-9513] aka "Resource Loop", is a DoS attack based on manipulation of
the RFC 7540 priority tree. Extensible priorities does not use stream
dependencies, which mitigates this vulnerability.

{{Section 5.3.4 of ?RFC7540}} describes a scenario where closure of streams in the
priority tree could cause suboptimal prioritization. To avoid this, {{?RFC7540}}
states that "an endpoint SHOULD retain stream prioritization state for a period
after streams become closed". Retaining state for streams no longer counted
towards stream concurrency consumes server resources. Furthermore, {{?RFC7540}}
identifies that reprioritization of a closed stream could affect dependents; it
recommends updating the priority tree if sufficient state is stored, which will
also consume server resources. To limit this commitment, it is stated that "The
amount of prioritization state that is retained MAY be limited" and "If a limit
is applied, endpoints SHOULD maintain state for at least as many streams as
allowed by their setting for SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS.". Extensible
priorities does not use stream dependencies, which minimizes most of the
resource concerns related to this scenario.

{{Section 5.3.4 of ?RFC7540}} also presents considerations about the state required
to store priority information about streams in an "idle" state. This state can
be limited by adopting the guidance about concurrency limits described above.
Extensible priorities is subject to a similar consideration because
PRIORITY_UPDATE frames may arrive before the request that they reference. A
server is required to store the information in order to apply the most
up-to-date signal to the request. However, HTTP/3 implementations might have
practical barriers to determining reasonable stream concurrency limits depending
on the information that is available to them from the QUIC transport layer.
TODO: so what can we suggest?

Roy Fielding presented the idea of using a header field for representing
priorities in <http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/83/slides/slides-83-httpbis-5.pdf>.
In <https://github.com/pmeenan/http3-prioritization-proposal>, Patrick Meenan
advocates for representing the priorities using a tuple of urgency and
concurrency. The ability to deprecate HTTP/2 prioritization is based on
{{?I-D.lassey-priority-setting}}, authored by Brad Lassey and Lucas Pardue, with
modifications based on feedback that was not incorporated into an update to that
document.

The motivation for defining an alternative to HTTP/2 priorities is drawn from
discussion within the broad HTTP community. Special thanks to Roberto Peon,
