  <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
    <t>
      This specification defines the HTTP QUERY request method as a means of
      making a safe, idempotent request that contains content.
    </t>
    <t>
      Most often, this is desirable when the data conveyed in a request is
      too voluminous to be encoded into the request's URI. For example,
      this is a common query pattern:
    </t>
<artwork type="http-message">
GET /feed?q=foo&amp;limit=10&amp;sort=-published HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
</artwork>
    <t>
      However, for a query with parameters that are complex or large,
      encoding it in the request URI may not be the best option because
    </t>
    <ul>
      <li>often size limits are not known ahead of time because a request can pass through many uncoordinated
    system (but note that <xref section="4.1" target="HTTP"/> recommends senders and recipients to support at least 8000 octets),</li>
      <li>expressing certain kinds of data in the target URI is inefficient because of the overhead of encoding that data into a valid URI, and</li>
      <li>encoding query parameters directly into the request URI effectively casts every possible combination of query inputs as distinct
          resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <t>
      As an alternative to using GET, many implementations make use of the
      HTTP POST method to perform queries, as illustrated in the example
      below. In this case, the input parameters to the query operation are
      passed along within the request content as opposed to using the
      request URI.
    </t>
    <t>
      A typical use of HTTP POST for requesting a query:
    </t>
<artwork type="http-message">
POST /feed HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

q=foo&amp;limit=10&amp;sort=-published
</artwork>
    <t>
      This variation, however, suffers from the same basic limitation as GET
      in that it is not readily apparent -- absent specific knowledge of the
      resource and server to which the request is being sent -- that a safe,
      idempotent query is being performed.
    </t>
    <t>
      The QUERY method provides a solution that spans the gap between the use of GET and POST, with
      the example above being expressed as:
    </t>
<artwork type="http-message">
QUERY /feed HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

q=foo&amp;limit=10&amp;sort=-published
</artwork>
    <t>
      As with POST, the input to the query operation is passed along within the content of the request
      rather than as part of the request URI. Unlike POST, however, the method is explicitly safe
      and idempotent, allowing functions like caching and automatic retries to operate.
    </t>

        This document uses terminology defined in <xref section="3" target="HTTP"/>.

    <section title="Notational Conventions" anchor="notational.conventions">
      <t>
        The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
        NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
        "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
        described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and only when, they
        appear in all capitals, as shown here.
      </t>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section title="QUERY" anchor="query">
    <t>
      The QUERY method is used to initiate a server-side query. Unlike
      the HTTP GET method, which requests that a server return a
      representation of the resource identified by the target URI
      (as defined by <xref target="HTTP" section="7.1"/>), the QUERY
      method is used to ask the server to perform a query operation
      (described by the request content) over some set of data scoped to the
      target URI. The content returned in response to a QUERY
      cannot be assumed to be a representation of the resource identified by
      the target URI.
    </t>
    <t>
      The content of the request defines the query. Implementations &MAY; use
      a request content of any media type with the QUERY method, provided that it
      has appropriate query semantics.
    </t>
    <t>
      QUERY requests are both safe and idempotent with regards to the
      resource identified by the request URI. That is, QUERY requests do not
      alter the state of the targeted resource. However, while processing a
      QUERY request, a server can be expected to allocate computing and memory
      resources or even create additional HTTP resources through which the
      response can be retrieved.
    </t>
    <t>
      A successful response to a QUERY request is expected to provide some
      indication as to the final disposition of the operation. For
      instance, a successful query that yields no results can be represented
      by a 204 No Content response. If the response includes content,
      it is expected to describe the results of the operation.
    </t>

    <section title="Content-Location and Location Fields" anchor="location">
    <t>
      Furthermore, a successful response can include a Content-Location
      header field (see <xref target="HTTP" section="8.7"/>) containing an
      identifier for a resource corresponding to the results of the
      operation. This represents a claim from the server that a client can send
      a GET request for the indicated URI to retrieve the results of the query
      operation just performed. The indicated resource might be temporary.
    </t>
    <t>
      A server &MAY; create or locate a resource that identifies the query
      operation for future use. If the server does so, the URI of the resource
      can be included in the Location header field of the response (see <xref
      target="HTTP" section="10.2.2"/>). This represents a claim that a client can
      send a GET request to the indicated URI to repeat the query operation just
      performed without resending the query parameters. This resource might be
      temporary; if a future request fails, the client can retry using the
      original QUERY resource and the previously submitted parameters again.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Redirection" anchor="redirection">
    <t>
      In some cases, the server may choose to respond indirectly to the QUERY
      request by redirecting the user agent to a different URI (see
      <xref target="HTTP" section="15.4"/>). The semantics of the redirect
      response do not differ from other methods. For instance, a 303 (See Other)
      response would indicate that the Location field identifies an
      alternate URI from which the results can be retrieved
      using a GET request (this use case is also covered by the
      use of the Location response field in a 2xx response).
      On the other hand, response codes 307 (Temporary Redirect) and 308
      (Permanent Redirect) can be used to request the user agent to redo
      the QUERY request on the URI specified by the Location field.
      Various non-normative examples of successful
      QUERY responses are illustrated in <xref target="examples" />.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Conditional Requests" anchor="conditional">
    <t>
      A conditional QUERY requests that the selected representation
      (i.e., the query results, after any content negotiation) be
      returned in the response only under the circumstances described by the
      conditional header field(s), as defined in
      <xref target="HTTP" section="13"/>.
    </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Caching" anchor="caching">
      <t>
        The response to a QUERY method is cacheable; a cache &MAY; use it to satisfy subsequent
        QUERY requests as per <xref target="HTTP-CACHING" section="4"/>).
      </t>
      <t>
        The cache key for a query (see <xref target="HTTP-CACHING" section="2"/>) &MUST;
        incorporate the request content. When doing so, caches &SHOULD; first normalize request
        content to remove semantically insignificant differences, thereby improving cache
        efficiency, by:
      </t>
      <ul>
        <li>Removing content encoding(s)</li>
        <li>Normalizing based upon knowledge of format conventions, as indicated by any media type suffix in the request's Content-Type field (e.g., "+json")</li>
        <li>Normalizing based upon knowledge of the semantics of the content itself, as indicated by the request's Content-Type field.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        Note that any such normalization is performed solely for the purpose of generating a cache key; it
        does not change the request itself.
      </t>
      </section>

    <section title="Range Requests" anchor="range">
    <t>
      The semantics of Range Requests for QUERY are identical to those for GET,
      as defined in <xref target="HTTP" section="14"/>.
    </t>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section title="The &quot;Accept-Query&quot; Header Field" anchor="field.accept-query">
    <t>
      The "Accept-Query" response header field can be used by a resource to
      directly signal support for the QUERY method while identifying
      the specific query format media type(s) that may be used.
    </t>
    <t>
      "Accept-Query" contains a list of media ranges (<xref target="HTTP" section="12.5.1"/>)
      using "Structured Fields" syntax (<xref target="STRUCTURED-FIELDS"/>).
      Media ranges are represented by a List Structured Header Field of either Tokens or
      Strings, containing the media range value without parameters. Parameters,
      if any, are mapped to Parameters of type String.
    </t>
    <t>
      The choice of Token vs. String is semantically insignificant. That is,
      recipients &MAY; convert Tokens to Strings, but &MUST-NOT; process them
      differently based on the received type.
    </t>
    <t>
      Media types do not exactly map to Tokens, for instance they
      allow a leading digit. In cases like these, the String format needs to
      be used.
    </t>
    <t>
      The only supported uses of wildcards are "*/*", which matches any type,
      or "xxxx/*", which matches any subtype of the indicated type.
    </t>
    <t>
      The order of types listed in the field value is not significant.
    </t>
    <t>
      The only allowed format for parameters is String.
    </t>
    <t>
      Accept-Query's value applies to every URI on the server that shares the same path; in
      other words, the query component is ignored. If requests to the same resource return
      different Accept-Query values, the most recently received fresh value (per
      <xref target="HTTP-CACHING" section="4.2"/>) is used.
    </t>
    <t>
      Example:
    </t>
    <artwork type="example">
Accept-Query: "application/jsonpath", application/sql;charset="UTF-8"</artwork>
    <t>
      Although the syntax for this field appears to be similar to other
      fields, such as "Accept" (<xref target="HTTP" section="12.5.1"/>),
      it is a Structured Field and thus &MUST; be processed as specified in
      <xref target="STRUCTURED-FIELDS" section="4"/>.
    </t>
  </section>

  <section title="Security Considerations">
    <t>
      The QUERY method is subject to the same general security
      considerations as all HTTP methods as described in
      <xref target="HTTP"/>.
    </t>
    <t>
      It can be used as an alternative to passing request
      information in the URI (e.g., in the query section). This is preferred in some
      cases, as the URI is more likely to be logged or otherwise processed
      by intermediaries than the request content.
      If a server creates a temporary resource to represent the results of a QUERY
      request (e.g., for use in the Location or Content-Location field) and the request
      contains sensitive information that cannot be logged, then the URI of this
      resource &SHOULD; be chosen such that it does not include any sensitive
      portions of the original request content.
    </t>
    <t>
      Caches that normalize QUERY content incorrectly or in ways that are
      significantly different from how the resource processes the content
      can return the incorrect response if normalization results in a false positive.
    </t>
    <t>
      A QUERY request from user agents implementing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
      will require a "preflight" request,
      as QUERY does not belong to the set of CORS-safelisted methods
      (see "<eref target="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#methods">Methods</eref>" in
      <xref target="FETCH"/>).

    <section title="Discovery of QUERY support" anchor="example.discovery.method">
      <t>
        A simple way to discover support for QUERY is provided by the OPTIONS
        (<xref target="HTTP" section="9.3.7"/>) method:
      </t>

<artwork type="http-message">
OPTIONS /contacts HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org

</artwork>

      <t>Response:</t>
<artwork type="http-message">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Allow: GET, QUERY, OPTIONS, HEAD
</artwork>
      <t>
        The Allow response field (<xref target="HTTP" section="10.2.1"/>) denotes the set of
        supported methods on the specified resource.
      </t>
      <t>
        There are alternatives to the use of OPTIONS. For instance, a QUERY request
        can be tried without prior knowledge of server support. The server would then
        either process the request, or could respond with an 4xx status such as 405 ("Method Not Allowed",
        <xref target="HTTP" section="15.5.6"/>), including the Allow response field.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section title="Discovery of QUERY Formats" anchor="example.discovery.formats">
      <t>
        Discovery of supported media types for QUERY is possible via the Accept-Query
        (<xref target="field.accept-query"/>) response field:
      </t>

<artwork type="http-message">
  HEAD /contacts HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.org

</artwork>

<t>Response:</t>
<artwork type="http-message">
  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/xhtml
  Accept-Query: application/x-www-form-urlencoded, application/sql
</artwork>
      <t>
        Responses to which request methods will contain Accept-Query will depend on
        the resource being accessed.
      </t>
      <t>
        An alternative to checking Accept-Query would be to make a QUERY request, and then
        - in case of a 4xx status such as 415 ("Unsupported Media Type", <xref target="HTTP" section="12.5.1"/>) response -
        to inspect the Allow (<xref target="HTTP" section="15.5.16"/>) response field:
      </t>

    <section title="Content-Location, Location, and Indirect Responses" anchor="example.content-location.location.indirect">
      <t>
        The Content-Location and Location response fields provide a way to identify alternate resources
        that will respond to GET requests, either for the received result of the request, or for future
        requests to perform the same operation. Going back to the example from <xref target="example.simple"/>:

        <t>
          Note that there's no guarantee that the server will implement this resource
          indefinitely, so, after an error response, the client would need to redo

          This is similar to including Location on a direct response, except that no result
