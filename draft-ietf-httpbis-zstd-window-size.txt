              Window Sizing for Zstandard Content Encoding
               draft-ietf-httpbis-zstd-window-size-latest

Abstract

   Deployments of Zstandard, or "zstd", can use different window sizes
   to limit memory usage during compression and decompression.  Some
   browsers and user agents limit window sizes to mitigate memory usage
   concerns, causing interoperability issues.  This document updates the
   window size limit in RFC8878 from a recommendation to a requirement
   in HTTP contexts.

1.  Introduction

   Zstandard, or "zstd", specified in [RFC8878], is a lossless data
   compression mechanism similar to gzip.  When used with HTTP, the
   "zstd" content coding token signals to the decoder that the content
   is Zstandard-compressed.

   An important property of Zstandard-compressed content is its
   Window_Size ([RFC8878], Section 3.1.1.1.2), which describes the
   maximum distance for back-references and therefore how much of the
   content must be kept in memory during decompression.

   The minimum Window_Size is 1 KB.  The maximum Window_Size is (1<<41)
   + 7*(1<<38) bytes, which is 3.75 TB.  Larger Window_Size values tend
   to improve the compression ratio, but at the cost of increased memory
   usage.

   To protect against unreasonable memory usage, some browsers and user
   agents limit the maximum Window_Size they will handle.  This causes
   failures to decode responses when the content is compressed with a
   larger Window_Size than the recipient allows, leading to decreased
   interoperability.

   [RFC8878], Section 3.1.1.1.2 recommends that decoders support a
   Window_Size of up to 8 MB, and that encoders not generate frames
   using a Window_Size larger than 8 MB.  However, it imposes no
   requirements.

   This document updates [RFC8878] to enforce Window_Size limits on the
   encoder and decoder for the "zstd" HTTP content coding.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Window Size

   To ensure interoperability, when using the "zstd" content coding,
   decoders MUST support a Window_Size of up to and including 8 MB, and
   encoders MUST NOT generate frames requiring a Window_Size larger than
   8 MB (see Section 5.1).

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [RFC8878].

   Note that decoders still need to take into account that they can
   receive oversized frames that do not follow the window size limit
   specified in this document and fail decoding when such invalid frames
   are received.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Content Encoding

   This document updates the entry added in [RFC8878] to the "HTTP
   Content Coding Registry" (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-
   parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#content-coding) within the
   "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Parameters"
   (https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-
   parameters.xhtml) registry:

   Name:  zstd

   Description:  A stream of bytes compressed using the Zstandard
      protocol with a Window_Size of not more than 8 MB.

   Reference:  This document and [RFC8878]
