--- abstract

This document updates RFC6265 by defining a `SameSite` attribute which allows
servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site
requests. This assertion allows user agents to mitigate the risk of cross-origin
information leakage, and provides some protection against cross-site request
forgery attacks.

# Introduction

Section 8.2 of {{RFC6265}} eloquently notes that cookies may be employed as a
form of ambient authority, attached by default to requests the user agent
sends on a user's behalf. Even when an attacker doesn't know the contents of a
user's cookies, she can still execute commands on the user's behalf (and with
the user's authority) by asking the user agent to send HTTP requests to unwary
servers. These malicious requests will include any of the user's previously-set
cookies, and therefore can be difficult to distinguish from benign requests on
the user's behalf.

Here, we update {{RFC6265}} with a simple mitigation strategy that allows
servers to declare certain cookies as "same-site", meaning they should not be
attached to "cross-site" requests (as defined in section 2.1 of this
specification).

Note that the mechanism outlined here is backwards compatible with the existing
cookie syntax. Servers may serve these cookies to all user agents; those that do
not support the `SameSite` attribute will simply store a cookie which is
attached to all relevant requests, just as they do today.

## Goals

Same-site cookies are intended to provide a solid layer of defense-in-depth
against attacks which require embedding an authenticated request into an
attacker-controlled context:

1. Timing attacks which yield cross-origin information leakage (such as those
   detailed in {{pixel-perfect}}) can be substantially mitigated by setting
   the `SameSite` attribute on authentication cookies. The attacker will
   only be able to embed unauthenticated resources, as embedding mechanisms such
   as `<iframe>` will yield cross-site requests.

2. Cross-site script inclusion (XSSI) attacks are likewise mitigated by setting
   the `SameSite` attribute on authentication cookies. The attacker will not be
   able to include authenticated resources via `<script>` or `<link>`, as these
   embedding mechanisms will likewise yield cross-site requests.

3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks which rely on top-level navigation
   (HTML `<form>` POSTs, for instance) can also be mitigated by treating these
   navigational requests as "cross-site".

4. Same-site cookies have some marginal value for policy or regulatory
   purposes, as cookies which are not delivered with cross-site requests cannot
   be directly used for tracking purposes. It may be valuable for an origin to
   assert that its cookies should not be sent along with cross-site requests in
   order to limit its exposure to non-technical risk.

## Examples

Same-site cookies are set via the `SameSite` attribute in the `Set-Cookie`
header field. That is, given a server's response to a user agent which contains
the following header field:

    Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; SameSite=Strict

Subsequent requests from that user agent can be expected to contain the
following header field if and only if both the requested resource and the
resource in the top-level browsing context match the cookie.

    Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

# Terminology and notation

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of
{{RFC5234}}.

Two sequences of octets are said to case-insensitively match each other if and
only if they are equivalent under the `i;ascii-casemap` collation defined in
{{RFC4790}}.

The terms "active document", "ancestor browsing context", "browsing context",
"dedicated worker", "Document", "WorkerGlobalScope", "sandboxed origin browsing
context flag", "parent browsing context", "shared worker", "the worker's
Documents", "nested browsing context", and "top-level browsing context" are
defined in {{HTML}}.

"Service Workers" are defined in the Service Workers specification
{{SERVICE-WORKERS}}.

The term "origin", the mechanism of deriving an origin from a URI, and the "the
same" matching algorithm for origins are defined in {{RFC6454}}.

"Safe" HTTP methods include `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, and `TRACE`, as defined
in Section 4.2.1 of {{RFC7231}}.

The term "public suffix" is defined in a note in Section 5.3 of {{RFC6265}} as
"a domain that is controlled by a public registry", and are also know as
"effective top-level domains" (eTLDs). For example, `example.com`'s public
suffix is `com`. User agents SHOULD use an up-to-date public suffix list,
such as the one maintained by Mozilla at {{PSL}}.

An origin's "registered domain" is the origin's host's public suffix plus the
label to its left. That is, for `https://www.example.com`, the public suffix is
`com`, and the registered domain is `example.com`. This concept is defined more
rigorously in {{PSL}}, and is also know as "effective top-level domain plus one"
(eTLD+1).

The term "request", as well as a request's "client", "current url", "method",
and "target browsing context", are defined in {{FETCH}}.

## "Same-site" and "cross-site" Requests  {#same-site-requests}

A request is "same-site" if its target's URI's origin's registered domain
is an exact match for the request's client's "site for cookies" or if the
request has no client, and "cross-site" otherwise. To be more precise, for a
given request ("request"), the following algorithm returns `same-site` or
`cross-site`:

1.  If `request`'s client is `null`, return `same-site`.

2.  Let `site` be `request`'s client's "site for cookies" (as defined in the
    following sections).

3.  Let `target` be the registered domain of `request`'s current url.

4.  If `site` is an exact match for `target`, return `same-site`.

5.  Return `cross-site`.

### Document-based requests {#document-requests}

The URI displayed in a user agent's address bar is the only security context
directly exposed to users, and therefore the only signal users can reasonably
rely upon to determine whether or not they trust a particular website. The
registered domain of that URI's origin represents the context in which a user
most likely believes themselves to be interacting. We'll label this domain the
"top-level site".

For a document displayed in a top-level browsing context, we can stop here: the
document's "site for cookies" is the top-level site.

For documents which are displayed in nested browsing contexts, we need to audit
the origins of each of a document's ancestor browsing contexts' active documents
in order to account for the "multiple-nested scenarios" described in Section 4
of {{RFC7034}}. These document's "site for cookies" is the top-level site if and
only if the document and each of its ancestor documents' origins have the same
registered domain as the top-level site. Otherwise its "site for cookies" is
the empty string.

Given a Document (`document`), the following algorithm returns its "site for
cookies" (either a registered domain, or the empty string):

1.  Let `top-document` be the active document in `document`'s browsing context's
    top-level browsing context.

2.  Let `top-origin` be the origin of `top-document`'s URI if `top-document`'s
    sandboxed origin browsing context flag is set, and `top-document`'s origin
    otherwise.

3.  Let `documents` be a list containing `document` and each of `document`'s
    ancestor browsing contexts' active documents.

4.  For each `item` in `documents`:

    1.  Let `origin` be the origin of `item`'s URI if `item`'s sandboxed origin
        browsing context flag is set, and `item`'s origin otherwise.

    2.  If `origin`'s host's registered domain is not an exact match for
        `top-origin`'s host's registered domain, return the empty string.

4.  Return `top-site`.

### Worker-based requests {#worker-requests}

Worker-driven requests aren't as clear-cut as document-driven requests, as
there isn't a clear link between a top-level browsing context and a worker.
This is especially true for Service Workers {{SERVICE-WORKERS}}, which may
execute code in the background, without any document visible at all.

Note: The descriptions below assume that workers must be same-origin with
the documents that instantiate them. If this invariant changes, we'll need to
take the worker's script's URI into account when determining their status.

#### Dedicated and Shared Workers {#dedicated-and-shared-requests}

Dedicated workers are simple, as each dedicated worker is bound to one and only
one document. Requests generated from a dedicated worker (via `importScripts`,
`XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch()`, etc) define their "site for cookies" as that
document's "site for cookies".

Shared workers may be bound to multiple documents at once. As it is quite
possible for those documents to have distinct "site for cookie" values, the
worker's "site for cookies" will be the empty string in cases where the values
diverge, and the shared value in cases where the values agree.

Given a WorkerGlobalScope (`worker`), the following algorithm returns its "site
for cookies" (either a registered domain, or the empty string):

1.  Let `site` be `worker`'s origin's host's registered domain.

2.  For each `document` in `worker`'s Documents:

    1.  Let `document-site` be `document`'s "site for cookies" (as defined
        in {{document-requests}}).

    2.  If `document-site` is not an exact match for `site`, return the empty
        string.

3.  Return `site`.

#### Service Workers

Service Workers are more complicated, as they act as a completely separate
execution context with only tangential relationship to the Document which
registered them.

Requests which simply pass through a service worker will be handled as described
above: the request's client will be the Document or Worker which initiated the
request, and its "site for cookies" will be those defined in
{{document-requests}} and {{dedicated-and-shared-requests}}

Requests which are initiated by the Service Worker itself (via a direct call to
`fetch()`, for instance), on the other hand, will have a client which is a
ServiceWorkerGlobalScope. Its "site for cookies" will be the registered domain
of the Service Worker's URI.

Given a ServiceWorkerGlobalScope (`worker`), the following algorithm returns its
"site for cookies" (either a registered domain, or the empty string):

1.  Return `worker`'s origin's host's registered domain.

# Server Requirements

This section describes extensions to {{RFC6265}} necessary to implement the
server-side requirements of the `SameSite` attribute.

## Grammar

Add `SameSite` to the list of accepted attributes in the `Set-Cookie` header
field's value by replacing the `cookie-av` token definition in Section 4.1.1
of {{RFC6265}} with the following ABNF grammar:

    cookie-av      = expires-av / max-age-av / domain-av /
                     path-av / secure-av / httponly-av /
                     samesite-av / extension-av
    samesite-av    = "SameSite=" samesite-value
    samesite-value = "Strict" / "Lax"

## Semantics of the "SameSite" Attribute (Non-Normative)

The "SameSite" attribute limits the scope of the cookie such that it will only
be attached to requests if those requests are same-site, as defined by the
algorithm in {{same-site-requests}}. For example, requests for
`https://example.com/sekrit-image` will attach same-site cookies if and only if
initiated from a context whose "site for cookies" is "example.com".

If the "SameSite" attribute's value is "Strict", the cookie will only be sent
along with "same-site" requests. If the value is "Lax", the cookie will be sent
with same-site requests, and with "cross-site" top-level navigations, as
described in {{strict-lax}}. If the "SameSite" attribute's value is neither of
these, the cookie will be ignored.

The changes to the `Cookie` header field suggested in {{cookie-header}} provide
additional detail.

# User Agent Requirements

This section describes extensions to {{RFC6265}} necessary in order to implement
the client-side requirements of the `SameSite` attribute.

## The "SameSite" attribute

The following attribute definition should be considered part of the the
`Set-Cookie` algorithm as described in Section 5.2 of {{RFC6265}}:

If the `attribute-name` case-insensitively matches the string "SameSite", the
user agent MUST process the `cookie-av` as follows:

1.  If `cookie-av`'s `attribute-value` is not a case-insensitive match for
    "Strict" or "Lax", ignore the `cookie-av`.

2.  Let `enforcement` be "Lax" if `cookie-av`'s `attribute-value` is a
    case-insensitive match for "Lax", and "Strict" otherwise.

3.  Append an attribute to the `cookie-attribute-list` with an `attribute-name`
    of "SameSite" and an `attribute-value` of `enforcement`.

### "Strict" and "Lax" enforcement {#strict-lax}

Same-site cookies in "Strict" enforcement mode will not be sent along with
top-level navigations which are triggered from a cross-site document context.
As discussed in {{top-level-navigations}}, this might or might not be compatible
with existing session management systems. In the interests of providing a
drop-in mechanism that mitigates the risk of CSRF attacks, developers may set
the `SameSite` attribute in a "Lax" enforcement mode that carves out an
exception which sends same-site cookies along with cross-site requests if and
only if they are top-level navigations which use a "safe" (in the {{RFC7231}}
sense) HTTP method.

Lax enforcement provides reasonable defense in depth against CSRF attacks that
rely on unsafe HTTP methods (like `POST`), but does not offer a robust defense
against CSRF as a general category of attack:

1. Attackers can still pop up new windows or trigger top-level navigations in
   order to create a "same-site" request (as described in section 2.1), which is
   only a speedbump along the road to exploitation.

2. Features like `<link rel='prerender'>` {{prerendering}} can be exploited
   to create "same-site" requests without the risk of user detection.

When possible, developers should use a session management mechanism such as
that described in {{top-level-navigations}} to mitigate the risk of CSRF more
completely.

## Monkey-patching the Storage Model

Note: There's got to be a better way to specify this. Until I figure out
what that is, monkey-patching!

Alter Section 5.3 of {{RFC6265}} as follows:

1.  Add `samesite-flag` to the list of each cookie's fields defined in the first
    paragraph. Note: this field's value is one of "None", "Strict", or "Lax".

2.  Before step 11 of the current algorithm, add the following:

    11. If the `cookie-attribute-list` contains an attribute with an
        `attribute-name` of "SameSite", set the cookie's `samesite-flag` to
        `attribute-value` ("Strict" or "Lax"). Otherwise, set the cookie's
        `samesite-flag` to "None".

    12.  If the cookie's `samesite-flag` is not "None", and the request
         which generated the cookie's client's "site for cookies" is not an
         exact match for `request-uri`'s host's registered domain, then
         abort these steps and ignore the newly created cookie entirely.

## Monkey-patching the "Cookie" header {#cookie-header}

Note: There's got to be a better way to specify this. Until I figure out
what that is, monkey-patching!

Alter Section 5.4 of {{RFC6265}} as follows:

1.  Add the following requirement to the end of the bulleted list in step 1:

    *   If the cookie's `samesite-flag` is not "None", and the HTTP request is
        cross-site (as defined in {{same-site-requests}}) then exclude the
        cookie unless all of the following statements hold:

        1.  `samesite-flag` is "Lax"

        2.  The HTTP request's method is "safe".

        3.  The HTTP request's target browsing context is a top-level browsing
            context.

Note that the modifications suggested here concern themselves only with the
"site for cookies" of the request's client, and the registered domain of the
resource being requested. The cookie's `domain`, `path`, and `secure` attributes
do not come into play for these comparisons.

# Authoring Considerations

## Defense in depth

"SameSite" cookies offer a robust defense against CSRF attack when deployed in
strict mode, and when supported by the client. It is, however, prudent to ensure
that this designation is not the extent of a site's defense against CSRF, as
same-site navigations and submissions can certainly be executed in conjunction
with other attack vectors such as cross-site scripting.

Developers are strongly encouraged to deploy the usual server-side defenses
(CSRF tokens, ensuring that "safe" HTTP methods are idempotent, etc) to mitigate
the risk more fully.

Additionally, client-side techniques such as those described in
{{app-isolation}} may also prove effective against CSRF, and are certainly worth
exploring in combination with "SameSite" cookies.

## Top-level Navigations {#top-level-navigations}

Setting the `SameSite` attribute in "strict" mode provides robust defense in
depth against CSRF attacks, but has the potential to confuse users unless sites'
developers carefully ensure that their cookie-based session management systems
deal reasonably well with top-level navigations.

Consider the scenario in which a user reads their email at MegaCorp Inc's
webmail provider `https://example.com/`. They might expect that clicking on an
emailed link to `https://projects.com/secret/project` would show them the secret
project that they're authorized to see, but if `projects.com` has marked their
session cookies as `SameSite`, then this cross-site navigation won't send them
along with the request. `projects.com` will render a 404 error to avoid leaking
secret information, and the user will be quite confused.

Developers can avoid this confusion by adopting a session management system that
relies on not one, but two cookies: one conceptually granting "read" access,
another granting "write" access. The latter could be marked as `SameSite`, and
its absence would prompt a reauthentication step before executing any
non-idempotent action. The former could drop the `SameSite` attribute entirely,
or choose the "Lax" version of enforcement, in order to allow users access to
data via top-level navigation.

## Mashups and Widgets

The `SameSite` attribute is inappropriate for some important use-cases. In
particular, note that content intended for embedding in a cross-site contexts
(social networking widgets or commenting services, for instance) will not have
access to same-site cookies. Cookies may be required for requests triggered in
these cross-site contexts in order to provide seamless functionality that relies
on a user's state.

Likewise, some forms of Single-Sign-On might require cookie-based authentication
in a cross-site context; these mechanisms will not function as intended with
same-site cookies.

# Privacy Considerations

## Server-controlled

Same-site cookies in and of themselves don't do anything to address the
general privacy concerns outlined in Section 7.1 of {{RFC6265}}. The SameSite
attribute is set by the server, and serves to mitigate the risk of certain kinds
of attacks that the server is worried about. The user is not involved in this
decision. Moreover, a number of side-channels exist which could allow a server
to link distinct requests even in the absence of cookies. Connection and/or
socket pooling, Token Binding, and Channel ID all offer explicit methods of
identification that servers could take advantage of.

## Pervasive Monitoring

As outlined in {{RFC7258}}, pervasive monitoring is an attack. Cookies play a
large part in enabling such monitoring, as they are responsible for maintaining
state in HTTP connections. We considered restricting same-site cookies to
secure contexts {{secure-contexts}} as a mitigation but decided against doing
so, as same-site cookies should result in a strict reduction in the number of
cookies floating around in cross-site contexts. That is, even if
`http://not-example.com` embeds a resource from `http://example.com/`, that
resource will not be "same-site", and `http://example.com`'s cookies simply
cannot be used to correlate user behavior across distinct origins.
