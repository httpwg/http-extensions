# Introduction

It is sometimes desirable to encrypt the contents of a HTTP message (request or
response) so that when the payload is stored (e.g., with a HTTP PUT), only
someone with the appropriate key can read it.

For example, it might be necessary to store a file on a server without exposing
its contents to that server. Furthermore, that same file could be replicated to
other servers (to make it more resistant to server or network failure),
downloaded by clients (to make it available offline), etc.  without exposing its
contents.

These uses are not met by the use of TLS {{?RFC5246}}, since it only encrypts
the channel between the client and server.

This document specifies a content coding (Section 3.1.2 of {{!RFC7231}}) for HTTP
to serve these and other use cases.

This content coding is not a direct adaptation of message-based encryption
formats - such as those that are described by {{?RFC4880}}, {{?RFC5652}},
{{?RFC7516}}, and {{XMLENC}} - which are not suited to stream processing, which
is necessary for HTTP.  The format described here follows more closely to the
lower level constructs described in {{!RFC5116}}.

To the extent that message-based encryption formats use the same primitives, the
format can be considered as sequence of encrypted messages with a particular
profile.  For instance, {{jwe}} explains how the format is congruent with a
sequence of JSON Web Encryption {{?RFC7516}} values with a fixed header.

This mechanism is likely only a small part of a larger design that uses content
encryption.  How clients and servers acquire and identify keys will depend on
the use case.  In particular, a key management system is not described.


## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{!RFC2119}}.


# The "aes128gcm" HTTP Content Coding {#aes128gcm}

The "aes128gcm" HTTP content coding indicates that a payload has been encrypted
using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as
identified as AEAD_AES_128_GCM in {{!RFC5116}}, Section 5.1.  The AEAD_AES_128_GCM
algorithm uses a 128 bit content encryption key.

Using this content coding requires knowledge of a key.  How this key is
acquired is not defined in this document.

The "aes128gcm" content coding uses a single fixed set of encryption
primitives.  Cipher suite agility is achieved by defining a new content coding
scheme.  This ensures that only the HTTP Accept-Encoding header field is
necessary to negotiate the use of encryption.

The "aes128gcm" content coding uses a fixed record size.  The final encoding
consists of a header (see {{header}}) and zero or more fixed size encrypted
records; the final record can be smaller than the record size.

The record size determines the length of each portion of plaintext that is
enciphered.  The record size ("rs") is included in the content coding header
(see {{header}}).

~~~ drawing
+-----------+             content
|   data    |             any length up to rs-17 octets
+-----------+
     |
     v
+-----------+-----+       add a delimiter octet (0x01 or 0x02)
|   data    | pad |       then 0x00-valued octets to rs-16
+-----------+-----+       (or less on the last record)
         |
         v
+--------------------+    encrypt with AEAD_AES_128_GCM;
|    ciphertext      |    final size is rs;
+--------------------+    the last record can be smaller
~~~

AEAD_AES_128_GCM produces ciphertext 16 octets longer than its input plaintext.
Therefore, the unencrypted content of each record is shorter than the record
size by 16 octets.  Valid records always contain at least a padding delimiter
octet and a 16 octet authentication tag.

Each record contains a single padding delimiter octet followed by any number of
zero octets.  The last record uses a padding delimiter octet set to the value 2,
all other records have a padding delimiter octet value of 1.

On decryption, the padding delimiter is the last non-zero valued octet of the
record.  A decrypter MUST fail if the record contains no non-zero octet.  A
decrypter MUST fail if the last record contains a padding delimiter with a value
other than 2 or if any record other than the last contains a padding delimiter
with a value other than 1.

The nonce for each record is a 96-bit value constructed from the record sequence
number and the input keying material.  Nonce derivation is covered in {{nonce}}.

The additional data passed to each invocation of AEAD_AES_128_GCM is a
zero-length octet sequence.

A consequence of this record structure is that range requests {{?RFC7233}} and
random access to encrypted payload bodies are possible at the granularity of the
record size.  Partial records at the ends of a range cannot be decrypted.  Thus,
it is best if range requests start and end on record boundaries.  Note however
that random access to specific parts of encrypted data could be confounded by
the presence of padding.

Selecting the record size most appropriate for a given situation requires a
trade-off.  A smaller record size allows decrypted octets to be released more
rapidly, which can be appropriate for applications that depend on
responsiveness.  Smaller records also reduce the additional data required if
random access into the ciphertext is needed.

Applications that don't depending on streaming, random access, or arbitrary
padding can use larger records, or even a single record.  A larger record size
reduces processing and data overheads.


## Encryption Content Coding Header {#header}

The content coding uses a header block that includes all parameters needed to
decrypt the content (other than the key).  The header block is placed in the
body of a message ahead of the sequence of records.

~~~ drawing
+-----------+--------+-----------+---------------+
| salt (16) | rs (4) | idlen (1) | keyid (idlen) |
+-----------+--------+-----------+---------------+
~~~

salt:

: The "salt" parameter comprises the first 16 octets of the "aes128gcm" content
  coding header.  The same "salt" parameter value MUST NOT be reused for two
  different payload bodies that have the same input keying material; generating
  a random salt for every application of the content coding ensures that content
  encryption key reuse is highly unlikely.

rs:

: The "rs" or record size parameter contains an unsigned 32-bit integer in
  network byte order that describes the record size in octets.  Note that it is
  therefore impossible to exceed the 2^36-31 limit on plaintext input to
  AEAD_AES_128_GCM.  Values smaller than 18 are invalid.

idlen:

: The "idlen" parameter is an unsigned 8-bit integer that defines the length of
  the "keyid" parameter.

keyid:

: The "keyid" parameter can be used to identify the keying material that is
  used.  This field is the length determined by the "idlen" parameter.
  Recipients that receive a message are expected to know how to retrieve keys;
  the "keyid" parameter might be input to that process.  A "keyid" parameter
  SHOULD be a UTF-8 {{!RFC3629}} encoded string, particularly where the
  identifier might need to be rendered in a textual form.


## Content Encryption Key Derivation {#derivation}

In order to allow the reuse of keying material for multiple different HTTP
messages, a content encryption key is derived for each message.  The content
encryption key is derived from the "salt" parameter using the HMAC-based key
derivation function (HKDF) described in {{!RFC5869}} using the SHA-256 hash
algorithm {{FIPS180-4}}.

The value of the "salt" parameter is the salt input to HKDF function.  The
keying material identified by the "keyid" parameter is the input keying material
(IKM) to HKDF.  Input keying material is expected to be provided to recipients
separately.  The extract phase of HKDF therefore produces a pseudorandom key
(PRK) as follows:

~~~ inline
   PRK = HMAC-SHA-256(salt, IKM)
~~~

The info parameter to HKDF is set to the ASCII-encoded string "Content-Encoding:
aes128gcm" and a single zero octet:

~~~ inline
   cek_info = "Content-Encoding: aes128gcm" || 0x00
~~~

Note(1):
: Concatenation of octet sequences is represented by the `||` operator.

Note(2):
: The strings used here and in {{nonce}} do not include a terminating 0x00
  octet, as is used in some programming languages.

AEAD_AES_128_GCM requires a 16 octet (128 bit) content encryption key (CEK), so
the length (L) parameter to HKDF is 16.  The second step of HKDF can therefore
be simplified to the first 16 octets of a single HMAC:

~~~ inline
   CEK = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, cek_info || 0x01)
~~~


## Nonce Derivation {#nonce}

The nonce input to AEAD_AES_128_GCM is constructed for each record.  The nonce
for each record is a 12 octet (96 bit) value that is derived from the record
sequence number, input keying material, and salt.

The input keying material and salt values are input to HKDF with different info
and length parameters.

The length (L) parameter is 12 octets.  The info parameter for the nonce is the
ASCII-encoded string "Content-Encoding: nonce", terminated by a a single zero
octet:

~~~ inline
   nonce_info = "Content-Encoding: nonce" || 0x00
~~~

The result is combined with the record sequence number - using exclusive or - to
produce the nonce.  The record sequence number (SEQ) is a 96-bit unsigned
integer in network byte order that starts at zero.

Thus, the final nonce for each record is a 12 octet value:

~~~ inline
   NONCE = HMAC-SHA-256(PRK, nonce_info || 0x01) XOR SEQ
~~~

This nonce construction prevents removal or reordering of records.


# Examples

This section shows a few examples of the encrypted content coding.

Note: All binary values in the examples in this section use Base 64 Encoding
with URL and Filename Safe Alphabet {{?RFC4648}}.  This includes the bodies of
requests.  Whitespace and line wrapping is added to fit formatting constraints.


## Encryption of a Response {#explicit}

Here, a successful HTTP GET response has been encrypted.  This uses a record
size of 4096 and no padding (just the single octet padding delimiter), so only a
partial record is present.  The input keying material is identified by an empty
string (that is, the "keyid" field in the header is zero octets in length).

The encrypted data in this example is the UTF-8 encoded string "I am the
walrus".  The input keying material is the value "yqdlZ-tYemfogSmv7Ws5PQ" (in
base64url).  The 54 octet content body contains a single record and is shown
here using 71 base64url characters for presentation reasons.

~~~ example
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Content-Length: 54
Content-Encoding: aes128gcm

I1BsxtFttlv3u_Oo94xnmwAAEAAA-NAVub2qFgBEuQKRapoZu-IxkIva3MEB1PD-
ly8Thjg
~~~

Note that the media type has been changed to "application/octet-stream" to avoid
exposing information about the content.  Alternatively (and equivalently), the
Content-Type header field can be omitted.

Intermediate values for this example (all shown using base64url):

~~~ inline
salt (from header) = I1BsxtFttlv3u_Oo94xnmw
PRK = zyeH5phsIsgUyd4oiSEIy35x-gIi4aM7y0hCF8mwn9g
CEK = _wniytB-ofscZDh4tbSjHw
NONCE = Bcs8gkIRKLI8GeI8
unencrypted data = SSBhbSB0aGUgd2FscnVzAg
~~~


## Encryption with Multiple Records

This example shows the same message with input keying material of
"BO3ZVPxUlnLORbVGMpbT1Q".  In this example, the plaintext is split into records
of 25 octets each (that is, the "rs" field in the header is 25).  The first
record includes one 0x00 padding octet.  This means that there are 7 octets of
message in the first record, and 8 in the second.  A key identifier of the UTF-8
encoded string "a1" is also included in the header.

~~~ example
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 73
Content-Encoding: aes128gcm

# Security Considerations

This mechanism assumes the presence of a key management framework that is used
to manage the distribution of keys between valid senders and receivers.
Defining key management is part of composing this mechanism into a larger
application, protocol, or framework.

Implementation of cryptography - and key management in particular - can be
difficult.  For instance, implementations need to account for the potential for
exposing keying material on side channels, such as might be exposed by the time
it takes to perform a given operation.  The requirements for a good
implementation of cryptographic algorithms can change over time.


## Automatic Decryption

As a content coding, a "aes128gcm" content coding might be automatically removed
by a receiver in way that is not obvious to the ultimate consumer of a message.
Recipients that depend on content origin authentication using this mechanism
MUST reject messages that don't include the "aes128gcm" content coding.


## Message Truncation

This content encoding is designed to permit the incremental processing of large
messages.  It also permits random access to plaintext in a limited fashion.  The
content encoding permits a receiver to detect when a message is truncated.

A partially delivered message MUST NOT be processed as though the entire message
was successfully delivered.  For instance, a partially delivered message cannot
be cached as though it were complete.

An attacker might exploit willingness to process partial messages to cause a
receiver to remain in a specific intermediate state.  Implementations performing
processing on partial messages need to ensure that any intermediate processing
states don't advantage an attacker.


## Key and Nonce Reuse

Encrypting different plaintext with the same content encryption key and nonce in
AES-GCM is not safe {{!RFC5116}}.  The scheme defined here uses a fixed progression
of nonce values.  Thus, a new content encryption key is needed for every
application of the content coding.  Since input keying material can be reused, a
unique "salt" parameter is needed to ensure a content encryption key is not
reused.

If a content encryption key is reused - that is, if input keying material and
salt are reused - this could expose the plaintext and the authentication key,
nullifying the protection offered by encryption.  Thus, if the same input keying
material is reused, then the salt parameter MUST be unique each time.  This
ensures that the content encryption key is not reused.  An implementation SHOULD
generate a random salt parameter for every message.


## Data Encryption Limits {#limits}

There are limits to the data that AEAD_AES_128_GCM can encipher.  The maximum
value for the record size is limited by the size of the "rs" field in the header
(see {{header}}), which ensures that the 2^36-31 limit for a single application
of AEAD_AES_128_GCM is not reached {{!RFC5116}}.  In order to preserve a 2^-40
probability of indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (IND-CPA), the
total amount of plaintext that can be enciphered with the key derived from the
same input keying material and salt MUST be less than 2^44.5 blocks of 16 octets
{{AEBounds}}.

If the record size is a multiple of 16 octets, this means 398 terabytes can be
encrypted safely, including padding and overhead.  However, if the record size
is not a multiple of 16 octets, the total amount of data that can be safely
encrypted is reduced because partial AES blocks are encrypted.  The worst case
is a record size of 18 octets, for which at most 74 terabytes of plaintext can
be encrypted, of which at least half is padding.


## Content Integrity

This mechanism only provides content origin authentication.  The authentication
tag only ensures that an entity with access to the content encryption key
produced the encrypted data.

Any entity with the content encryption key can therefore produce content that
will be accepted as valid.  This includes all recipients of the same HTTP
message.

Furthermore, any entity that is able to modify both the Content-Encoding header
field and the HTTP message body can replace the contents.  Without the content
encryption key or the input keying material, modifications to or replacement of
parts of a payload body are not possible.


## Leaking Information in Header Fields

Because only the payload body is encrypted, information exposed in header fields
is visible to anyone who can read the HTTP message.  This could expose
side-channel information.

For example, the Content-Type header field can leak information about the
payload body.

There are a number of strategies available to mitigate this threat, depending
upon the application's threat model and the users' tolerance for leaked
information:

1. Determine that it is not an issue. For example, if it is expected that all
   content stored will be "application/json", or another very common media type,
   exposing the Content-Type header field could be an acceptable risk.

2. If it is considered sensitive information and it is possible to determine it
   through other means (e.g., out of band, using hints in other representations,
   etc.), omit the relevant headers, and/or normalize them. In the case of
   Content-Type, this could be accomplished by always sending Content-Type:
   application/octet-stream (the most generic media type), or no Content-Type at
   all.

3. If it is considered sensitive information and it is not possible to convey it
   elsewhere, encapsulate the HTTP message using the application/http media type
   (Section 8.3.2 of {{!RFC7230}}), encrypting that as the payload of the "outer"
   message.


## Poisoning Storage

This mechanism only offers data origin authentication; it does not perform
authentication or authorization of the message creator, which could still need
to be performed (e.g., by HTTP authentication {{?RFC7235}}).

This is especially relevant when a HTTP PUT request is accepted by a server
without decrypting the payload; if the request is unauthenticated, it becomes
possible for a third party to deny service and/or poison the store.


## Sizing and Timing Attacks

Applications using this mechanism need to be aware that the size of encrypted
messages, as well as their timing, HTTP methods, URIs and so on, may leak
sensitive information.  See for example {{?NETFLIX=DOI.10.1145/3029806.3029821}}
or {{CLINIC}}.

This risk can be mitigated through the use of the padding that this mechanism
provides.  Alternatively, splitting up content into segments and storing them
separately might reduce exposure. HTTP/2 {{?RFC7540}} combined with TLS
{{?RFC5246}} might be used to hide the size of individual messages.

Developing a padding strategy is difficult.  A good padding strategy can depend
on context.  Common strategies include padding to a small set of fixed lengths,
padding to multiples of a value, or padding to powers of 2.  Even a good
strategy can still cause size information to leak if processing activity of a
recipient can be observed.  This is especially true if the trailing records of a
message contain only padding.  Distributing non-padding data across records is
recommended to avoid leaking size information.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

## The "aes128gcm" HTTP Content Coding

This memo registers the "aes128gcm" HTTP content coding in the HTTP Content
Codings Registry, as detailed in {{aes128gcm}}.

* Name: aes128gcm
* Description: AES-GCM encryption with a 128-bit content encryption key
* Reference: this specification

# JWE Mapping {#jwe}

The "aes128gcm" content coding can be considered as a sequence of JSON Web
Encryption (JWE) objects {{?RFC7516}}, each corresponding to a single fixed size
record that includes trailing padding.  The following transformations are applied
to a JWE object that might be expressed using the JWE Compact Serialization:

* The JWE Protected Header is fixed to the value { "alg": "dir", "enc": "A128GCM"
  }, describing direct encryption using AES-GCM with a 128-bit content
  encryption key.  This header is not transmitted, it is instead implied by the
  value of the Content-Encoding header field.

* The JWE Encrypted Key is empty, as stipulated by the direct encryption algorithm.

* The JWE Initialization Vector ("iv") for each record is set to the exclusive
  or of the 96-bit record sequence number, starting at zero, and a value derived
  from the input keying material (see {{nonce}}).  This value is also not
  transmitted.

* The final value is the concatenated header, JWE Ciphertext, and JWE
  Authentication Tag, all expressed without base64url encoding.  The "."
  separator is omitted, since the length of these fields is known.

Thus, the example in {{explicit}} can be rendered using the JWE Compact
Serialization as:
