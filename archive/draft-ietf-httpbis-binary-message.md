# Introduction

This document defines a simple format for representing an HTTP message
{{HTTP}}, either request or response. This allows for the encoding of HTTP
messages that can be conveyed outside an HTTP protocol. This enables the
transformation of entire messages, including the application of authenticated
encryption.

The design of this format is informed by the framing structure of HTTP/2 {{H2}}
and HTTP/3 {{H3}}.  Rules for constructing messages rely on the rules defined in
HTTP/2, but the format itself is distinct; see {{differences}}.

This format defines "`message/bhttp`", a binary alternative to the
"`message/http`" content type defined in {{MESSAGING}}. A binary format permits
more efficient encoding and processing of messages. A binary format also reduces
exposure to security problems related to processing of HTTP messages.

Two modes for encoding are described:

* a known-length encoding includes length prefixes for all major message
  components, and

* an indeterminate-length encoding enables efficient generation of messages
  where lengths are not known when encoding starts.

This format is designed to convey the semantics of valid HTTP messages as simply
and efficiently as possible.  It is not designed to capture all of the details
of the encoding of messages from specific HTTP versions {{MESSAGING}} {{H2}}
{{H3}}.  As such, this format is unlikely to be suitable for applications that
depend on an exact recording of the encoding of messages.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses terminology from HTTP {{HTTP}} and notation from QUIC
({{Section 1.3 of QUIC}}).


# Format

{{Section 6 of HTTP}} defines the general structure of HTTP messages and
composes those messages into distinct parts.  This format describes how those
parts are composed into a sequence of bytes.  At a high level, binary messages
are comprised of:

1. Framing indicator. This format uses a single integer to describe framing, which describes
   whether the message is a request or response and how subsequent sections are
   formatted; see {{framing}}.

2. For a response, zero or more informational responses.  Each informational
   response consists of an informational status code and header section.

3. Control data. For a request, this contains the request method and target.
   For a response, this contains the status code.

4. Header section.  This contains zero or more header fields.

5. Content.  This is a sequence of zero or more bytes.

6. Trailer section.  This contains zero or more trailer fields.

7. Optional padding. Any amount of zero-valued bytes.

All lengths and numeric values are encoded using the variable-length integer
encoding from {{Section 16 of QUIC}}.  Integer values do not need to be encoded
on the minimum number of bytes necessary.


## Known-Length Messages

A request or response that has a known length at the time of construction uses
the format shown in {{format-known-length}}.

~~~ quic-format
Known-Length Request {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 0,
  Request Control Data (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
  Known-Length Content (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
  Padding (..),
}

Known-Length Response {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 1,
  Known-Length Informational Response (..) ...,
  Final Response Control Data (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
  Known-Length Content (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
  Padding (..),
}

Known-Length Field Section {
  Length (i),
  Field Line (..) ...,
}

Known-Length Content {
  Content Length (i),
  Content (..),
}

Known-Length Informational Response {
  Informational Response Control Data (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-known-length title="Known-Length Message"}

A known-length request consists of a framing indicator ({{framing}}), request
control data ({{request-control}}), a header section with a length prefix,
binary content with a length prefix, a trailer section with a length prefix, and
padding.

A known-length response contains the same fields, with the exception that
request control data is replaced by zero or more informational responses
({{informational}}) followed by response control data ({{response-control}}).

For a known-length encoding, the length prefix on field sections and content is
a variable-length encoding of an integer.  This integer is the number of bytes
in the field section or content, not including the length field itself.

Fields in the header and trailer sections consist of a length-prefixed name and
length-prefixed value; see {{fields}}.

The format allows for the message to be truncated before any of the length
prefixes that precede the field sections or content; see {{padding}}.

The variable-length integer encoding means that there is a limit of
2<sup>62</sup>-1 bytes for each field section and the message content.


## Indeterminate-Length Messages

A request or response that is constructed without encoding a known length for
each section uses the format shown in {{format-indeterminate-length}}:

~~~ quic-format
Indeterminate-Length Request  {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 2,
  Request Control Data (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Content (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
  Padding (..),
}

Indeterminate-Length Response  {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 3,
  Indeterminate-Length Informational Response (..) ...,
  Final Response Control Data (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Content (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
  Padding (..),
}

Indeterminate-Length Content {
  Indeterminate-Length Content Chunk (..) ...,
  Content Terminator (i) = 0,
}

Indeterminate-Length Content Chunk {
  Chunk Length (i) = 1..,
  Chunk (..),
}

Indeterminate-Length Field Section {
  Field Line (..) ...,
  Content Terminator (i) = 0,
}

Indeterminate-Length Informational Response {
  Informational Response Control Data (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-indeterminate-length title="Indeterminate-Length Message"}

An indeterminate-length request consists of a framing indicator ({{framing}}),
request control data ({{request-control}}), a header section that is terminated
by a zero value, any number of non-zero-length chunks of binary content, a zero
value, a trailer section that is terminated by a zero value, and padding.

An indeterminate-length response contains the same fields, with the exception
that request control data is replaced by zero or more informational responses
({{informational}}) and response control data ({{response-control}}).

The indeterminate-length encoding only uses length prefixes for content blocks.
Multiple length-prefixed portions of content can be included, each prefixed by a
non-zero Chunk Length integer describing the number of bytes in the block.  The
Chunk Length is encoded as a variable-length integer.

Each Field Line in an Indeterminate-Length Field Section starts with a
Name Length field.  An Indeterminate-Length Field Section ends with a Content
Terminator field.  The zero value of the Content Terminator distinguishes it
from the Name Length field, which cannot contain a value of 0.

Indeterminate-length messages can be truncated in a way similar to that for
known-length messages; see {{padding}}.

Indeterminate-length messages use the same encoding for Field Line as
known-length messages; see {{fields}}.


## Framing Indicator {#framing}

The start of each binary message is a framing indicator that is a single integer that
describes the structure of the subsequent sections. The framing indicator can
take just four values:

* A value of 0 describes a request of known length.
* A value of 1 describes a response of known length.
* A value of 2 describes a request of indeterminate length.
* A value of 3 describes a response of indeterminate length.

Other values cause the message to be invalid; see {{invalid}}.


## Request Control Data {#request-control}

The control data for a request message contains the method and request target.
That information is encoded as an ordered sequence of fields: Method, Scheme,
Authority, Path. Each of these fields is prefixed with a length.

The values of these fields follow the rules in HTTP/2 ({{Section 8.3.1 of H2}})
that apply to the "`:method`", "`:scheme`", "`:authority`", and "`:path`" pseudo-header
fields, respectively. However, where the "`:authority`" pseudo-header field might
be omitted in HTTP/2, a zero-length value is encoded instead.

The format of request control data is shown in {{format-request-control-data}}.

~~~ quic-format
Request Control Data {
  Method Length (i),
  Method (..),
  Scheme Length (i),
  Scheme (..),
  Authority Length (i),
  Authority (..),
  Path Length (i),
  Path (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-request-control-data title="Format of Request Control Data"}


## Response Control Data {#response-control}

The control data for a response message consists of the status code. The status
code ({{Section 15 of HTTP}}) is encoded as a variable-length integer, not a
length-prefixed decimal string.

The format of final response control data is shown in
{{format-response-control-data}}.

~~~ quic-format
Final Response Control Data {
  Status Code (i) = 200..599,
}
~~~
{: #format-response-control-data title="Format of Final Response Control Data"}


### Informational Status Codes {#informational}

Responses that include informational status codes (see {{Section 15.2 of HTTP}})
are encoded by repeating the response control data and associated header section
until a final status code is encoded; that is, a Status Code field with a value
from 200 to 599 (inclusive).  The status code distinguishes between
informational and final responses.

The format of the informational response control data is shown in
{{format-informational}}.

~~~ quic-format
Informational Response Control Data {
  Status Code (i) = 100..199,
}
~~~
{: #format-informational title="Format of Informational Response Control Data"}

A response message can include any number of informational responses that
precede a final status code.  These convey an informational status code and a
header block.

If the response control data includes an informational status code (that is, a
value between 100 and 199 inclusive), the control data is followed by a header
section (encoded with known length or indeterminate length according to the
framing indicator) and another block of control data.  This pattern repeats
until the control data contains a final status code (200 to 599 inclusive).


## Header and Trailer Field Lines {#fields}

Header and trailer sections consist of zero or more field lines; see {{Section 5
of HTTP}}. The format of a field section depends on whether the message is of
known length or indeterminate length.

Each Field Line encoding includes a name and a value. Both the name and value
are length-prefixed sequences of bytes.  The Name field is a minimum of one
byte. The format of a Field Line is shown in {{format-field-line}}.

~~~ quic-format
Field Line {
  Name Length (i) = 1..,
  Name (..),
  Value Length (i),
  Value (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-field-line title="Format of a Field Line"}

For field names, byte values that are not permitted in an HTTP field name cause
the message to be invalid; see {{Section 5.1 of HTTP}} for a definition of what
is valid and {{invalid}} regarding the handling of invalid messages.  A
recipient MUST treat a message that contains field values that would cause an
HTTP/2 message to be malformed according to {{Section 8.2.1 of H2}} as invalid;
see {{invalid}}.

The same field name can be repeated over more than one field line; see {{Section
5.2 of HTTP}} for the semantics of repeated field names and rules for combining
values.

Messages are invalid ({{invalid}}) if they contain fields named "`:method`",
"`:scheme`", "`:authority`", "`:path`", or "`:status`".  Other pseudo-fields
that are defined by protocol extensions MAY be included; pseudo-fields cannot be
included in trailers (see {{Section 8.1 of H2}}).  A Field Line containing
pseudo-fields MUST precede other Field Line values.  A message that contains a
pseudo-field after any other field is invalid; see {{invalid}}.

Fields that relate to connections ({{Section 7.6.1 of HTTP}}) cannot be used to
produce the effect on a connection in this context.  These fields SHOULD be
removed when constructing a binary message.  However, they do not cause a
message to be invalid ({{invalid}}); permitting these fields allows a binary
message to capture messages that are exchanged in a protocol context.

Like HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, this format has an exception for the combination of
multiple instances of the `Cookie` field. Instances of fields with the
ASCII-encoded value of "`cookie`" are combined using a semicolon octet (0x3b)
rather than a comma; see {{Section 8.2.3 of H2}}.


## Content

The content of messages is a sequence of bytes of any length. Though a
known-length message has a limit, this limit is large enough that it is
unlikely to be a practical limitation. There is no limit to the size of content
in an indeterminate-length message.


## Padding and Truncation {#padding}

Messages can be padded with any number of zero-valued bytes.  Non-zero padding
bytes cause a message to be invalid (see {{invalid}}). Unlike other parts of a
message, a processor MAY decide not to validate the value of padding bytes.

Truncation can be used to reduce the size of messages that have no data in
trailing field sections or content.  If the trailers of a message are empty,
they MAY be omitted by the encoder in place of adding a length field equal to
zero. An encoder MAY omit empty content in the same way if the trailers are also
empty.  A message that is truncated at any other point is invalid; see
{{invalid}}.

Decoders MUST treat missing truncated fields as equivalent to having been sent
with the length field set to zero.

Padding is compatible with truncation of empty parts of the messages.
Zero-valued bytes will be interpreted as a zero-length part, which is
semantically equivalent to the part being absent.


# Invalid Messages {#invalid}

This document describes a number of ways that a message can be invalid. Invalid
messages MUST NOT be processed further except to log an error and produce an
error response.

The format is designed to allow incremental processing. Implementations need to
be aware of the possibility that an error might be detected after performing
incremental processing.


# Examples

This section includes example requests and responses encoded in both
known-length and indeterminate-length forms.

## Request Example

The example HTTP/1.1 message in {{ex-request}} shows the content in the
"`message/http`" format.

Valid HTTP/1.1 messages require lines terminated with CRLF (the two bytes 0x0d
and 0x0a). For simplicity and consistency, the content of these examples is
limited to text, which also uses CRLF for line endings.

~~~ http-message
GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en, mi

~~~
{: #ex-request title="Sample HTTP Request"}

This can be expressed as a binary message (type "`message/bhttp`") using a
known-length encoding as shown in hexadecimal in {{ex-bink-request}}.
{{ex-bink-request}} includes text alongside to show that most of the content is
not modified.

~~~ hex-dump

~~~
{: #ex-bink-request title="Known-Length Binary Encoding of Request"}

This example shows that the Host header field is not replicated in the
"`:authority`" field, as is required for ensuring that the request is reproduced
accurately; see {{Section 8.3.1 of H2}}.

The same message can be truncated with no effect on interpretation. In this
case, the last two bytes -- corresponding to content and a trailer section --
can each be removed without altering the semantics of the message.

The same message, encoded using an indeterminate-length encoding, is shown in
{{ex-bini-request}}. As the content of this message is empty, the difference in
formats is negligible.

~~~ hex-dump
02034745 54056874 74707300 0a2f6865  ..GET.https../he

~~~
{: #ex-bini-request title="Indeterminate-Length Binary Encoding of Request"}

This indeterminate-length encoding contains 10 bytes of padding.  As two
additional bytes can be truncated in the same way as the known-length example,
anything up to 12 bytes can be removed from this message without affecting its
meaning.


## Response Example

Response messages can contain interim (1xx) status codes, as the message in
{{ex-response}} shows. {{ex-response}} includes examples of informational status
codes 102 and 103, as defined in {{?RFC2518}} (now obsolete but defines status
code 102) and {{?RFC8297}}, respectively.

~~~ http-message

A response that uses the chunked encoding (see {{Section 7.1 of MESSAGING}}) as
shown in {{ex-chunked}} can be encoded using indeterminate-length encoding,
which minimizes buffering needed to translate into the binary format. However,
chunk boundaries do not need to be retained, and any chunk extensions cannot be
conveyed using the binary format; see {{differences}}.

# Notable Differences with HTTP Protocol Messages {#differences}

This format is designed to carry HTTP semantics just like HTTP/1.1
{{MESSAGING}}, HTTP/2 {{H2}}, or HTTP/3 {{H3}}.  However, there are some notable
differences between this format and the format used in an interactive protocol
version.

In particular, as a standalone representation, this format lacks the following
features of the formats used in those protocols:

* chunk extensions ({{Section 7.1.1 of MESSAGING}}) and transfer encoding
  ({{Section 6.1 of MESSAGING}})

* generic framing and extensibility capabilities

* field blocks other than a single header and trailer field block

* carrying reason phrases in responses ({{Section 4 of MESSAGING}})

* header compression {{?HPACK=RFC7541}} {{?QPACK=RFC9204}}

* response framing that depends on the corresponding request (such as HEAD) or
  the value of the status code (such as 204 or 304); these responses use the
  same framing as all other messages

Some of these features are also absent in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.

Unlike HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, this format uses a fixed format for control data
rather than using pseudo-fields.

Note that while some messages -- CONNECT or upgrade requests in particular --
can be represented using this format, doing so serves no purpose, as these
requests are used to affect protocol behavior, which this format cannot do
without additional mechanisms.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Many of the considerations that apply to HTTP message handling apply to this
format; see {{Section 17 of HTTP}} and {{Section 11 of MESSAGING}} for common
issues in handling HTTP messages.

Strict parsing of the format with no tolerance for errors can help avoid a
number of attacks. However, implementations still need to be aware of the
possibility of resource exhaustion attacks that might arise from receiving
large messages, particularly those with large numbers of fields.

Implementations need to ensure that they aren't subject to resource exhaustion
attacks from maliciously crafted messages.  Overall, the format is designed to
allow for minimal state when processing messages.  However, producing a combined
field value ({{Section 5.2 of HTTP}}) for fields might require the commitment of
resources.  In particular, combining might be necessary for the `Cookie` field
when translating this format for use in other contexts, such as use in an API or
translation to HTTP/1.1 {{MESSAGING}}, where the recipient of the field might
not expect multiple values.


# IANA Considerations

IANA has added the media type "`message/bhttp`" to the "Media Types" registry at
