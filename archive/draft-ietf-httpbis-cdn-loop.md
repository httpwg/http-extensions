--- abstract

This document defines the CDN-Loop request header field for HTTP. CDN-Loop addresses an operational
need that occurs when an HTTP request is intentionally forwarded between Content Delivery Networks
(CDNs), but is then accidentally or maliciously re-routed back into the original CDN causing a
non-terminating loop. The new header field can be used to identify the error and terminate the loop.

# Introduction

In modern deployments of HTTP servers, it is common to interpose Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
in front of origin servers to improve latency perceived by end users, reduce operational costs, and
improve scalability and reliability of services.

Often, more than one CDN is in use by a given origin. This happens for a variety of reasons, such
as cost savings, arranging for failover should one CDN have issues, or direct comparison
of the CDNs' services.

As a result, it is possible for forwarding CDNs to be configured in a "loop" accidentally;
because routing is achieved through a combination of DNS and forwarding rules, and site
configurations are sometimes complex and managed by several parties.

When this happens, it is difficult to debug. Additionally, it sometimes isn't accidental; loops
between multiple CDNs can be used as an attack vector (e.g., see {{loop-attack}}), especially if one
CDN unintentionally strips the loop detection headers of another.

This specification defines the CDN-Loop HTTP request header field to help
detect such attacks and accidents among forwarding CDNs that have implemented
it; the header field may not be modified by their customers.

## Relationship to Via

HTTP defines the Via header field in Section 5.7.1 of {{!RFC7230}} for "tracking message forwards,
avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of senders along the
request/response chain."

In theory, Via could be used to identify these loops. However, in practice it is not used in this
fashion, because some HTTP servers use Via for other purposes -- in particular, some
implementations disable some HTTP/1.1 features when the Via header is present.


## Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of {{!RFC5234}} with a list
extension, defined in Section 7 of {{!RFC7230}}, that allows for compact definition of
comma-separated lists using a '#' operator (similar to how the '*' operator indicates repetition).
Additionally, it uses a token (OWS), uri-host, and port rules from {{!RFC7230}} and the parameter
rule from {{!RFC7231}}.


# The CDN-Loop Request Header Field {#header}

The CDN-Loop request header field is intended to help a Content Delivery Network identify when an incoming request has already passed through that CDN's servers to detect loops.

~~~ abnf
CDN-Loop  = #cdn-info
cdn-info  = cdn-id *( OWS ";" OWS parameter )
cdn-id    = ( uri-host [ ":" port ] ) / pseudonym
pseudonym = token
~~~

The cdn-id identifies the CDN using either a hostname under its control or a pseudonym. Hostnames
are preferred, to help avoid accidental collisions. If a pseudonym is used, unintentional collisions are more likely, and therefore values should be carefully chosen to prevent them; for example, using a well-known value (such as the recognized name of the CDN in question), or a generated value with enough entropy to make collisions unlikely (such as a UUID {{?RFC4122}}).

Optionally, cdn-info can have semicolon-separated key/value parameters to accommodate additional
information for the CDN's use.

Conforming Content Delivery Networks SHOULD add a cdn-info to this header field in all requests they
generate or forward (creating the header field if necessary).

As with all HTTP header fields defined using the "#" rule, the CDN-Loop header field can be added to by comma-separating values, or by creating a new header field with the desired value.

For example:

~~~ example
GET /image.jpg HTTP/1.1
Host: cdn-customer.example
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/5
CDN-Loop: foo123.foocdn.example, barcdn.example; trace="abcdef"
CDN-Loop: AnotherCDN; abc=123; def="456"

~~~

Note that the pseudonym syntax does not allow whitespace, DQUOTE, or any of the characters
"(),/:;<=>?@[\]{}". See Section 3.2.6 of {{!RFC7230}}. Likewise, note the rules for when parameter
values need to be quoted in Section 3.1.1 of {{!RFC7231}}.

The effectiveness of this mechanism relies on all intermediaries preserving the header field, since
removing (or allowing it to be removed, e.g., by customer configuration) would prevent downstream
CDNs from using it to detect looping. In general, unknown header fields are not removed by
intermediaries, but there may be a need to add CDN-Loop to an implementation's list of header fields
that are not to be removed under any circumstances. The header field SHOULD NOT be used for other
purposes.

# Security Considerations

The threat model that the CDN-Loop header field addresses is a customer who is attacking a service
provider by configuring a forwarding loop by accident or malice. For it to function, CDNs cannot
allow customers to modify or remove it in their configuration (see {{header}}).

Note that a CDN that allows customers to remove or modify the CDN-Loop header field (i.e., they do
not implement this specification) remains an attack vector against both implementing and
non-implementing CDNs.

A CDN's use of the CDN-Loop header field might expose its presence. For example, if CDN A is configured to forward its requests to CDN B for a given origin, CDN B's presence can be revealed if it behaves differently based upon the presence of the CDN-Loop header field.

The CDN-Loop header field can be generated by any client, and therefore its contents cannot be
trusted. CDNs who modify their behavior based upon its contents should assure that this does not
become an attack vector (e.g., for Denial of Service).

It is possible to sign the contents of the header field (either by putting the signature directly
into the field's content or using another header field), but such use is not defined (or required)
by this specification.

Depending on how it is used, CDN-Loop can expose information about the internal configuration of the CDN; for example, the number of hops inside the CDN, and the hostnames of nodes.
