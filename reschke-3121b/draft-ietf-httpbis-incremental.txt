1.  Introduction

   HTTP [HTTP] permits receivers to begin processing portions of HTTP
   messages as they arrive, rather than requiring them to wait for the
   entire HTTP message to be received before acting.

   Some applications are specifically designed to take advantage of this
   capability.

   For example, Server-Sent Events [SSE] uses a long-running HTTP
   response, where the server continually sends notifications as they
   become available.

   In the case of Chunked Oblivious HTTP Messages [CHUNKED-OHTTP], the
   client opens an HTTP request and incrementally sends application
   messages, while the server can start responding even before the HTTP
   request is fully complete.  In this way, the HTTP request-response
   pair could create what is, in effect, a bi-directional communication
   channel.

   Applications that rely on incremental delivery of messages are
   fragile when HTTP intermediaries are involved.  This is because HTTP
   intermediaries are not only permitted but are frequently deployed to
   buffer complete HTTP messages before forwarding them downstream
   (Section 7.6 of [HTTP]).

   If such a buffering HTTP intermediary exists between the client and
   the server, these applications may fail to function as intended.

   In the case of Server-Sent Events, an intermediary that tries to
   buffer the HTTP response completely before forwarding it could be
   left waiting indefinitely.  A client might never receive any portion
   of the response.

   In the case of requests that involve any bi-directional exchange, an
   intermediary that tries to buffer entire messages -- either request
   or response -- prevents any data from being delivered.

   To help avoid such behavior, this document specifies the
   "Incremental" HTTP header field, which instructs HTTP intermediaries
   to begin forwarding the HTTP message downstream before receiving the
   complete message.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document relies on structured field definitions of Item and
   Boolean [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].

3.  The Incremental Header Field

   The Incremental HTTP header field expresses the sender's intent for
   HTTP intermediaries to start forwarding the message downstream before
   the entire message is received.

   The Incremental header field is defined as a structured field
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] of type Item.  There is just one valid value,
   which is of type Boolean: "?1".

   Incremental = ?1

   Upon receiving a header section that includes an Incremental header
   field with a true value, HTTP intermediaries SHOULD NOT buffer the
   entire message before forwarding it.  Instead, intermediaries SHOULD
   transmit the header section downstream and continuously forward the
   bytes of the message body as they arrive.  As the Incremental header
   field indicates only how the message content is to be forwarded,
   intermediaries can still buffer the entire header and trailer
   sections of the message before forwarding them downstream.

   The Incremental HTTP header field applies to each HTTP message.
   Therefore, if both the HTTP request and response need to be forwarded
   incrementally, the Incremental HTTP header field MUST be set for both
   the HTTP request and the response.

   The Incremental field is advisory.  Intermediaries that are unaware
   of the field or that do not support the field might buffer messages,
   even when explicitly requested otherwise.  Clients and servers
   therefore cannot expect all intermediaries to understand and respect
   a request to deliver messages incrementally.  Clients can rely on
   prior knowledge or probe for support on individual resources.

   The Incremental header field facilitates the establishment of a
   bidirectional byte channel over HTTP, as its presence in both
   requests and responses instructs intermediaries to forward early
   responses (Section 7.5 of [HTTP]) and to transmit message contents
   incrementally in both directions.  However, when developing
   bidirectional protocols over HTTP, Extended CONNECT
   [RFC8441][RFC9220] is generally more consistent with HTTP's
   architecture.

4.  Security Considerations

   To conserve resources required to handle HTTP requests or
   connections, it is common for intermediaries to impose limits on the
   maximum number of concurrent HTTP requests that they forward, while
   buffering requests that exceed this limit.

   Such intermediaries could apply a more restrictive concurrency limit
   to requests marked as incremental to ensure that capacity remains
   available for non-incremental requests, even when the maximum number
   of incremental requests is reached.  This approach helps balance the
   processing of different types of requests and maintains service
   availability across all requests.

   When rejecting incremental requests due to reaching the concurrency
   limit, intermediaries SHOULD respond with a 503 Service Unavailable
   error, accompanied by a connection_limit_reached Proxy-Status
   response header field (Section 2.3.12 of [PROXY-STATUS]).

   For performance and efficiency reasons, a small amount of buffering
   might be used by intermediaries, even for incremental messages.
   Immediate forwarding might be exploited to cause an intermediary to
   waste effort on many small packets.  Enabling incremental delivery
   might instead set limits on the number bytes that are buffered or the
   time that buffers are held before forwarding.  Any buffering could
   adversely affect application latency, even if it improves efficiency.
   In all cases, intermediaries cannot hold data in buffers
   indefinitely, so data needs to be forwarded when either the time
   limit or the byte limit is reached.

5.  IANA Considerations

   An HTTP field named Incremental is registered in the Hypertext
   Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry, following the
   procedures in Section 18.4 of [HTTP].  The following values are
   registered:

   Field Name:  Incremental
   Status:  permanent
   Structured Type:  Item
   Reference:  This document
   Comments:  None
