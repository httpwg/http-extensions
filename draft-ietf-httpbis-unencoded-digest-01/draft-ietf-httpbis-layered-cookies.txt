                Cookies: HTTP State Management Mechanism
               draft-ietf-httpbis-layered-cookies-latest

Abstract

   This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
   These header fields can be used by HTTP servers to store state
   (called cookies) at HTTP user agents, letting the servers maintain a
   stateful session over the mostly stateless HTTP protocol.  Although
   cookies have many historical infelicities that degrade their security
   and privacy, the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields are widely used
   on the Internet.  This document obsoletes RFC 6265 and 6265bis.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines the HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.
   Using the Set-Cookie header field, an HTTP server can pass name/value
   pairs and associated metadata (called cookies) to a user agent.  When
   the user agent makes subsequent requests to the server, the user
   agent uses the metadata and other information to determine whether to
   return the name/value pairs in the Cookie header field.

   Although simple on their surface, cookies have a number of
   complexities.  For example, the server can scope the maximum amount
   of time during which the user agent should return the cookie, the
   servers to which the user agent should return the cookie, and whether
   the cookie can be accessed through a non-HTTP API, such as JavaScript
   in a web browser.

   For historical reasons, cookies contain a number of security and
   privacy infelicities.  For example, a server can indicate that a
   given cookie is intended for "secure" connections, but the cookie's
   Secure attribute does not provide integrity in the presence of an
   active network attacker.  Similarly, cookies for a given host are
   shared across all the ports on that host, even though the usual
   "same-origin policy" used by web browsers isolates content retrieved
   via different ports.

   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of these header
   fields.  Where some existing software differs from the requirements
   in significant ways, the document contains a note explaining the
   difference.

   This document obsoletes [RFC6265] and 6265bis.

1.1.  Examples

   Using the Set-Cookie header field, a server can send the user agent a
   short string in an HTTP response that the user agent will return in
   future HTTP requests that are within the scope of the cookie.  For
   example, the server can send the user agent a "session identifier"
   named SID with the value 31d4d96e407aad42.  The user agent then
   returns the session identifier in subsequent requests.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   The server can alter the default scope of the cookie using the Path
   and Domain attributes.  For example, the server can instruct the user
   agent to return the cookie to every path and every subdomain of
   site.example.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Domain=site.example

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

   As shown in the next example, the server can store multiple cookies
   at the user agent.  For example, the server can store a session
   identifier as well as the user's preferred language by returning two
   Set-Cookie header fields.  Notice that the server uses the Secure and
   HttpOnly attributes to provide additional security protections for
   the more sensitive session identifier (see Section 4.1.2).

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; Path=/; Secure; HttpOnly
   Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Path=/; Domain=site.example

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

   Notice that the Cookie header field above contains two cookies, one
   named SID and one named lang.

   Cookie names are case-sensitive, meaning that if a server sends the
   user agent two Set-Cookie header fields that differ only in their
   name's case the user agent will store and return both of those
   cookies in subsequent requests.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42
   Set-Cookie: sid=31d4d96e407aad42

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; sid=31d4d96e407aad42

   If the server wishes the user agent to persist the cookie over
   multiple "sessions" (e.g., user agent restarts), the server can
   specify an expiration date in the Expires attribute.  Note that the
   user agent might delete the cookie before the expiration date if the
   user agent's cookie store exceeds its quota or if the user manually
   deletes the server's cookie.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: lang=en-US; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

   Finally, to remove a cookie, the server returns a Set-Cookie header
   field with an expiration date in the past.  The server will be
   successful in removing the cookie only if the Path and the Domain
   attribute in the Set-Cookie header field match the values used when
   the cookie was created.

   == Server -> User Agent ==

   Set-Cookie: lang=; Expires=Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT

   == User Agent -> Server ==

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Terminology

   This specification depends on Infra.  [INFRA]

   Some terms used in this specification are defined in the following
   standards and specifications:

   *  HTTP [RFC9110]

   *  URL [URL]

   A *non-HTTP API* is a non-HTTP mechanisms used to set and retrieve
   cookies, such as a web browser API that exposes cookies to
   JavaScript.

2.2.  ABNF

   This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
   notation of [RFC5234].

   The following core rules are included by reference, as defined in
   [RFC5234], Appendix B.1: ALPHA (letters), CR (carriage return), CRLF
   (CR LF), CTLs (controls), DIGIT (decimal 0-9), DQUOTE (double quote),
   HEXDIG (hexadecimal 0-9/A-F/a-f), LF (line feed), NUL (null octet),
   OCTET (any 8-bit sequence of data except NUL), SP (space), HTAB
   (horizontal tab), CHAR (any ASCII byte), VCHAR (any visible ASCII
   byte), and WSP (whitespace).

   The OWS (optional whitespace) and BWS (bad whitespace) rules are
   defined in Section 5.6.3 of [RFC9110].

3.  Which Requirements to Implement

   The upcoming two sections, Section 4 and Section 5, discuss the set
   of requirements for two distinct types of implementations.  This
   section is meant to help guide implementers in determining which set
   of requirements best fits their goals.  Choosing the wrong set of
   requirements could result in a lack of compatibility with other
   cookie implementations.

   It's important to note that being compatible means different things
   depending on the implementer's goals.  These differences have built
   up over time due to both intentional and unintentional specification
   changes, specification interpretations, and historical implementation
   differences.

   This section roughly divides implementers of this specification into
   two types, producers and consumers.  These are not official terms and
   are only used here to help readers develop an intuitive understanding
   of the use cases.

3.1.  Cookie Producing Implementations

   An implementer should choose Section 4 whenever cookies are created
   and will be sent to a user agent, such as a web browser.  These
   implementations are frequently referred to as servers by the
   specification but that term includes anything which primarily
   produces cookies.  Some potential examples:

   *  Server applications hosting a website or API

   *  Programming languages or software frameworks that support cookies

   *  Integrated third-party web applications, such as a business
      management suite

   All these benefit from not only supporting as many user agents as
   possible but also supporting other servers.  This is useful if a
   cookie is produced by a software framework and is later sent back to
   a server application which needs to read it.  Section 4 advises best
   practices that help maximize this sense of compatibility.

3.2.  Cookie Consuming Implementations

   An implementer should choose Section 5 whenever cookies are primarily
   received from another source.  These implementations are referred to
   as user agents.  Some examples:

   *  Web browsers

   *  Tools that support stateful HTTP

   *  Programming languages or software frameworks that support cookies

   Because user agents don't know which servers a user will access, and
   whether or not that server is following best practices, users agents
   are advised to implement a more lenient set of requirements and to
   accept some things that servers are warned against producing.
   Section 5 advises best practices that help maximize this sense of
   compatibility.

3.3.  Programming Languages & Software Frameworks

   A programming language or software framework with support for cookies
   could reasonably be used to create an application that acts as a
   cookie producer, cookie consumer, or both.  Because a developer may
   want to maximize their compatibility as either a producer or
   consumer, these languages or frameworks should strongly consider
   supporting both sets of requirements, Section 4 and Section 5, behind
   a compatibility mode toggle.  This toggle should default to
   Section 4's requirements.

   Doing so will reduce the chances that a developer's application can
   inadvertently create cookies that cannot be read by other servers.

4.  Server Requirements

   This section describes the conforming syntax and semantics of the
   HTTP Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.

4.1.  Set-Cookie

   The Set-Cookie HTTP response header field is used to send cookies
   from the server to the user agent.

   Origin servers MAY send a Set-Cookie response header field with any
   response.  An origin server can include multiple Set-Cookie header
   fields in a single response.  The presence of a Cookie or a Set-
   Cookie header field does not preclude HTTP caches from storing and
   reusing a response.

   Origin servers and intermediaries MUST NOT combine multiple Set-
   Cookie header fields into a single header field.  The usual mechanism
   for combining HTTP headers fields (i.e., as defined in Section 5.3 of
   [RFC9110]) might change the semantics of the Set-Cookie header field
   because the %x2C (",") character is used by Set-Cookie in a way that
   conflicts with such combining.

   For example,

   Set-Cookie: a=b;path=/c,d=e

   is ambiguous.  It could be intended as two cookies, a=b and d=e, or a
   single cookie with a path of /c,d=e.

4.1.1.  Syntax

   Informally, the Set-Cookie response header field contains a cookie,
   which begins with a name-value-pair, followed by zero or more
   attribute-value pairs.  Servers MUST send Set-Cookie header fields
   that conform to the following grammar:

   set-cookie        = set-cookie-string
   set-cookie-string = BWS cookie-pair *( BWS ";" OWS cookie-av )
   cookie-pair       = cookie-name BWS "=" BWS cookie-value
   cookie-name       = token
   cookie-value      = *cookie-octet / ( DQUOTE *cookie-octet DQUOTE )
   cookie-octet      = %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-3A / %x3C-5B / %x5D-7E
                         ; US-ASCII characters excluding CTLs,
                         ; whitespace, DQUOTE, comma, semicolon,
                         ; and backslash
   token             = <token, defined in [HTTP], Section 5.6.2>

   cookie-av         = expires-av / max-age-av / domain-av /
                       path-av / secure-av / httponly-av /
                       samesite-av / extension-av
   expires-av        = "Expires" BWS "=" BWS sane-cookie-date
   sane-cookie-date  =
       <IMF-fixdate, defined in [HTTP], Section 5.6.7>
   max-age-av        = "Max-Age" BWS "=" BWS non-zero-digit *DIGIT
   non-zero-digit    = %x31-39
                         ; digits 1 through 9
   domain-av         = "Domain" BWS "=" BWS domain-value
   domain-value      = <subdomain>
                         ; see details below
   path-av           = "Path" BWS "=" BWS path-value
   path-value        = *av-octet
   secure-av         = "Secure"
   httponly-av       = "HttpOnly"
   samesite-av       = "SameSite" BWS "=" BWS samesite-value
   samesite-value    = "Strict" / "Lax" / "None"
   extension-av      = *av-octet
   av-octet          = %x20-3A / %x3C-7E
                         ; any CHAR except CTLs or ";"

   Note that some of the grammatical terms above reference documents
   that use different grammatical notations than this document (which
   uses ABNF from [RFC5234]).

   Per the grammar above, servers MUST NOT produce nameless cookies
   (i.e., an empty cookie-name) as such cookies may be unpredictably
   serialized by user agents when sent back to the server.

   The semantics of the cookie-value are not defined by this document.

   To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers that wish to
   store arbitrary data in a cookie-value SHOULD encode that data, for
   example, using Base64 [RFC4648].

   Per the grammar above, the cookie-value MAY be wrapped in DQUOTE
   characters.  Note that in this case, the initial and trailing DQUOTE
   characters are not stripped.  They are part of the cookie-value, and
   will be included in Cookie header fields sent to the server.

   The domain-value is a subdomain as defined by [RFC1034], Section 3.5,
   and as enhanced by [RFC1123], Section 2.1.  Thus, domain-value is a
   byte sequence of ASCII bytes.

   The portions of the set-cookie-string produced by the cookie-av term
   are known as attributes.  To maximize compatibility with user agents,
   servers SHOULD NOT produce two attributes with the same name in the
   same set-cookie-string.

   NOTE: The name of an attribute-value pair is not case-sensitive.  So
   while they are presented here in CamelCase, such as HttpOnly or
   SameSite, any case is accepted.  E.g., httponly, Httponly, hTTPoNLY,
   etc.

   Servers MUST NOT include more than one Set-Cookie header field in the
   same response with the same cookie-name.  (See Section 5.5.1 for how
   user agents handle this case.)

   If a server sends multiple responses containing Set-Cookie header
   fields concurrently to the user agent (e.g., when communicating with
   the user agent over multiple sockets), these responses create a "race
   condition" that can lead to unpredictable behavior.

   NOTE: Some existing user agents differ in their interpretation of
   two-digit years.  To avoid compatibility issues, servers SHOULD use
   the rfc1123-date format, which requires a four-digit year.

   NOTE: Some user agents store and process dates in cookies as 32-bit
   UNIX time_t values.  Implementation bugs in the libraries supporting
   time_t processing on some systems might cause such user agents to
   process dates after the year 2038 incorrectly.

4.1.2.  Semantics (Non-Normative)

   This section describes simplified semantics of the Set-Cookie header
   field.  These semantics are detailed enough to be useful for
   understanding the most common uses of cookies by servers.  The full
   semantics are described in Section 5.

   When the user agent receives a Set-Cookie header field, the user
   agent stores the cookie together with its attributes.  Subsequently,
   when the user agent makes an HTTP request, the user agent includes
   the applicable, non-expired cookies in the Cookie header field.

   If the user agent receives a new cookie with the same cookie-name,
   domain-value, and path-value as a cookie that it has already stored,
   the existing cookie is evicted and replaced with the new cookie.
   Notice that servers can delete cookies by sending the user agent a
   new cookie with an Expires attribute with a value in the past.

   Unless the cookie's attributes indicate otherwise, the cookie is
   returned only to the origin server (and not, for example, to any
   subdomains), and it expires at the end of the current session (as
   defined by the user agent).  User agents ignore unrecognized cookie
   attributes (but not the entire cookie).

4.1.2.1.  The Expires Attribute

   The Expires attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie,
   represented as the date and time at which the cookie expires.  The
   user agent is not required to retain the cookie until the specified
   date has passed.  In fact, user agents often evict cookies due to
   memory pressure or privacy concerns.

4.1.2.2.  The Max-Age Attribute

   The Max-Age attribute indicates the maximum lifetime of the cookie,
   represented as the number of seconds until the cookie expires.  The
   user agent is not required to retain the cookie for the specified
   duration.  In fact, user agents often evict cookies due to memory
   pressure or privacy concerns.

   NOTE: Some existing user agents do not support the Max-Age attribute.
   User agents that do not support the Max-Age attribute ignore the
   attribute.

   If a cookie has both the Max-Age and the Expires attribute, the Max-
   Age attribute has precedence and controls the expiration date of the
   cookie.  If a cookie has neither the Max-Age nor the Expires
   attribute, the user agent will retain the cookie until "the current
   session is over" (as defined by the user agent).

4.1.2.3.  The Domain Attribute

   The Domain attribute specifies those hosts to which the cookie will
   be sent.

   If the server includes the Domain attribute, the value applies to
   both the specified domain and any subdomains.  For example, if the
   value of the Domain attribute is "site.example", the user agent will
   include the cookie in the Cookie header field when making HTTP
   requests to site.example, www.site.example, and
   www.corp.site.example.  Note that a leading %x2E ("."), if present,
   is ignored even though that character is not permitted.

   If the server omits the Domain attribute, the user agent will return
   the cookie only to the origin server and not to any subdomains.

   WARNING: Some existing user agents treat an absent Domain attribute
   as if the Domain attribute were present and contained the current
   host name.  For example, if site.example returns a Set-Cookie header
   field without a Domain attribute, these user agents will erroneously
   send the cookie to www.site.example and www.corp.site.example as
   well.

   The user agent will reject cookies unless the Domain attribute
   specifies a scope for the cookie that would include the origin
   server.  For example, the user agent will accept a cookie with a
   Domain attribute of "site.example" or of "foo.site.example" from
   foo.site.example, but the user agent will not accept a cookie with a
   Domain attribute of "bar.site.example" or of "baz.foo.site.example".

4.1.2.4.  The Path Attribute

   The scope of each cookie is limited to a set of paths, controlled by
   the Path attribute.  If the server omits the Path attribute, the user
   agent will use the "directory" of the request-uri's path component as
   the default value.  (See Section 5.3.3 for more details.)

   The user agent will include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the
   path portion of the request-uri matches (or is a subdirectory of) the
   cookie's Path attribute, where the %x2F ("/") character is
   interpreted as a directory separator.

   Although seemingly useful for isolating cookies between different
   paths within a given host, the Path attribute cannot be relied upon
   for security (see Section 8).

4.1.2.5.  The Secure Attribute

   The Secure attribute limits the scope of the cookie to "secure"
   channels (where "secure" is outside the scope of this document).
   E.g., when a cookie has the Secure attribute, the user agent will
   include the cookie in an HTTP request only if the request is
   transmitted over a secure channel (typically HTTP over Transport
   Layer Security (TLS) [TLS13] [RFC9110]).

4.1.2.6.  The HttpOnly Attribute

   The HttpOnly attribute limits the scope of the cookie to HTTP
   requests.  In particular, the attribute instructs the user agent to
   omit the cookie when providing access to cookies via non-HTTP APIs.

4.1.2.7.  The SameSite Attribute

   The SameSite attribute limits the scope of the cookie upon creation
   and delivery with respect to whether the cookie is considered to be
   "same-site" within a larger context (where "same-site" is outside the
   scope of this document).  The SameSite attribute is particularly
   relevant for web browsers and web applications accessible through
   them.

   The SameSite attribute supports Strict, Lax, and None as values.

4.1.3.  Cookie Name Prefixes

   Section 8.5 and Section 8.6 of this document spell out some of the
   drawbacks of cookies' historical implementation.  In particular, it
   is impossible for a server to have confidence that a given cookie was
   set with a particular set of attributes.  In order to provide such
   confidence in a backwards-compatible way, two common sets of
   requirements can be inferred from the first few characters of the
   cookie's name.

   To maximize compatibility with user agents, servers SHOULD use
   prefixes as described below.

4.1.3.1.  The "__Secure-" Prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __Secure-, then the cookie will have been set with a Secure
   attribute.

   For example, the following Set-Cookie header field would be rejected
   by a conformant user agent, as it does not have a Secure attribute.

   Set-Cookie: __Secure-SID=12345; Domain=site.example

   Whereas the following Set-Cookie header field would be accepted if
   set from a secure origin (e.g. https://site.example/), and rejected
   otherwise:

   Set-Cookie: __Secure-SID=12345; Domain=site.example; Secure

4.1.3.2.  The "__Host-" Prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __Host-, then the cookie will have been set with a Secure attribute,
   a Path attribute with a value of /, and no Domain attribute.

   This combination yields a cookie that hews as closely as a cookie can
   to treating the origin as a security boundary.  The lack of a Domain
   attribute ensures that cookie's host-only is true, locking the cookie
   to a particular host, rather than allowing it to span subdomains.
   Setting the Path to / means that the cookie is effective for the
   entire host, and won't be overridden for specific paths.  The Secure
   attribute ensures that the cookie is unaltered by non-secure origins,
   and won't span protocols.

   Ports are the only piece of the same-origin policy that __Host-
   cookies continue to ignore.

   For example, the following cookies would always be rejected:

   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345
   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345; Secure
   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345; Domain=site.example
   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345; Domain=site.example; Path=/
   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345; Secure; Domain=site.example; Path=/

   While the following would be accepted if set from a secure origin
   (e.g. https://site.example/), and rejected otherwise:

   Set-Cookie: __Host-SID=12345; Secure; Path=/

4.1.3.3.  The "__Http-" Prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __Http-, then the cookie will have been set with a Secure attribute,
   and an HttpOnly attribute.

   This helps developers and server operators to know that the cookie
   was set using a Set-Cookie header, and is limited in scope to HTTP
   requests.

4.1.3.4.  The "__HostHttp-" prefix

   If a cookie's name begins with a case-sensitive match for the string
   __HostHttp-, then the cookie will have been set with a Secure
   attribute, an HttpOnly attribute, a Path attribute with a value of /,
   and no Domain attribute.

   This helps developers and server operators to know that the cookie
   was set using a Set-Cookie header, and is limited in scope to HTTP
   requests.

   This combination yields a cookie that hews as closely as a cookie can
   to treating the origin as a security boundary, while at the same time
   ensuring developers and server operators know that its scope is
   limited to HTTP requests.  The lack of a Domain attribute ensures
   that cookie's host-only is true, locking the cookie to a particular
   host, rather than allowing it to span subdomains.  Setting the Path
   to / means that the cookie is effective for the entire host, and
   won't be overridden for specific paths.  The Secure attribute ensures
   that the cookie is unaltered by non-secure origins, and won't span
   protocols.  The HttpOnly attribute ensures that the cookie is not
   exposed by the user agent to non-HTTP APIs.

4.2.  Cookie

4.2.1.  Syntax

   The user agent sends stored cookies to the origin server in the
   Cookie header field.  If the server conforms to the requirements in
   Section 4.1 (and the user agent conforms to the requirements in
   Section 5), the user agent will send a Cookie header field that
   conforms to the following grammar:

   cookie        = cookie-string
   cookie-string = cookie-pair *( ";" SP cookie-pair )

   While Section 5.4 of [RFC9110] does not define a length limit for
   header fields it is likely that the web server's implementation does
   impose a limit; many popular implementations have default limits of 8
   kibibytes.  Servers SHOULD avoid setting a large number of large
   cookies such that the final cookie-string would exceed their header
   field limit.  Not doing so could result in requests to the server
   failing.

   Servers MUST be tolerant of multiple Cookie headers.  For example, an
   HTTP/2 [RFC9113] or HTTP/3 [HTTP] client or intermediary might split
   a Cookie header to improve compression.  Servers are free to
   determine what form this tolerance takes.  For example, the server
   could process each Cookie header individually or the server could
   concatenate all the Cookie headers into one and then process that
   final, single, header.  The server should be mindful of any header
   field limits when deciding which approach to take.

   Note: Since intermediaries can modify Cookie headers they should also
   be mindful of common server header field limits in order to avoid
   sending servers headers that they cannot process.  For example,
   concatenating multiple cookie headers into a single header might
   exceed a server's size limit.

4.2.2.  Semantics

   Each cookie-pair represents a cookie stored by the user agent.  The
   cookie-pair contains the cookie-name and cookie-value the user agent
   received in the Set-Cookie header field.

   Notice that the cookie attributes are not returned.  In particular,
   the server cannot determine from the Cookie field alone when a cookie
   will expire, for which hosts the cookie is valid, for which paths the
   cookie is valid, or whether the cookie was set with the Secure or
   HttpOnly attributes.

   The semantics of individual cookies in the Cookie header field are
   not defined by this document.  Servers are expected to imbue these
   cookies with application-specific semantics.

   Although cookies are serialized linearly in the Cookie header field,
   servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the serialization order.  In particular,
   if the Cookie header field contains two cookies with the same name
   (e.g., that were set with different Path or Domain attributes),
   servers SHOULD NOT rely upon the order in which these cookies appear
   in the header field.

5.  User Agent Requirements

   This section specifies the processing models associated with the
   Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields in sufficient detail that a user
   agent can interoperate with existing servers (even those that do not
   conform to the well-behaved profile described in Section 4).

   A user agent could enforce more restrictions than those specified
   herein (e.g., restrictions specified by its cookie policy, described
   in Section 7.2).  However, such additional restrictions may reduce
   the likelihood that a user agent will be able to interoperate with
   existing servers.

5.1.  Cookie Concepts

   To facilitate the algorithms that follow, a number of pre-requisite
   concepts need to be introduced.

5.1.1.  Cookie Store And Limits

   A user agent has an associated *cookie store*, which is a list of
   cookies.  It is initially « ».

   A user agent has an associated *total cookies-per-host limit*, which
   is an integer.  It SHOULD be 50 or more.

   A user agent has an associated *total cookies limit*, which is an
   integer.  It SHOULD be 3000 or more.

   A user agent has an associated *cookie age limit*, which is a number
   of days.  It SHOULD be 400 days or less (see Section 7.2).

5.1.2.  Cookie Struct

   A *cookie* is a struct that represents a piece of state to be
   transmitted between a client and a server.

   A cookie's *name* is a byte sequence.  It always needs to be set.

   A cookie's *value* is a byte sequence.  It always needs to be set.

   A cookie's *secure* is a boolean.  It is initially false.

   A cookie's *host* is a domain, IP address, null, or failure.  It is
   initially null.  Note: Once a cookie is in the user agent's cookie
   store its host is a domain or IP address.

   A cookie's *host-only* is a boolean.  It is initially false.

   A cookie's *path* is a URL path.

   A cookie's *has-path attribute* is a boolean.  It is initially false.

   A cookie's *same-site* is "strict", "lax", "unset", or "none".  It is
   initially "unset".

   A cookie's *http-only* is a boolean.  It is initially false.

   A cookie's *creation-time* is a time.  It is initially the current
   time.

   A cookie's *expiry-time* is null or a time.  It is initially null.
   Note: A prior version of this specification referred to null with a
   distinct "persistent-flag" field being false.

   A cookie's *last-access-time* is a time.  It is initially the current
   time.

5.1.2.1.  Cookie Struct Miscellaneous

   A cookie is *expired* if its expiry-time is non-null and its expiry-
   time is in the past.

   A cookie _cookie_ is *Host-prefix compatible* if:

   1.  _cookie_'s secure is true;

   2.  _cookie_'s host-only is true;

   3.  _cookie_'s has-path attribute is true; and

   4.  _cookie_'s path's size is 1 and _cookie_'s path[0] is the empty
       string,

   A cookie _cookie_ is *Http-prefix compatible* if:

   1.  _cookie_'s secure is true; and

   2.  _cookie_'s http-only is false,

5.2.  Cookie Store Eviction

5.2.1.  Remove Expired Cookies

   1.  Let _expiredCookies_ be a list of references to all expired
       cookies in the user agent's cookie store.

   2.  For each _cookie_ of _expiredCookies_:

       1.  Remove _cookie_ from the user agent's cookie store.

   3.  Return _expiredCookies_.

5.2.2.  Remove Excess Cookies for a Host

   To *Remove Excess Cookies for a Host* given a host _host_:

   1.  Let _insecureCookies_ be a list of references to all cookies in
       the user agent's cookie store whose host is host-equal to _host_
       and whose secure is false.

   2.  Sort _insecureCookies_ by earliest last-access-time first.

   3.  Let _secureCookies_ be a list of references to all cookies in the
       user agent's cookie store whose host is host-equal to _host_ and
       whose secure is true.

   4.  Sort _secureCookies_ by earliest last-access-time first.

   5.  Let _excessHostCookies_ be an empty list of cookies.

   6.  While _insecureCookies_'s size + _secureCookies_'s size is
       greater than the user agent's total cookies-per-host limit:

       1.  If _insecureCookies_ is not empty:

           1.  Let _cookie_ be the first item of _insecureCookies_.

           2.  Remove _cookie_ from _insecureCookies_.

           3.  Remove _cookie_ from the user agent's cookie store.

           4.  Append _cookie_ to _excessHostCookies_.

       2.  Otherwise:

           1.  Let _cookie_ be the first item of _secureCookies_.

           2.  Remove _cookie_ from _secureCookies_.

           3.  Remove _cookie_ from the user agent's cookie store.

           4.  Append _cookie_ to _excessHostCookies_.

   7.  Return _excessHostCookies_.

5.2.3.  Remove Global Excess Cookies

   To *Remove Global Excess Cookies*:

   1.  Let _allCookies_ be the result of sorting the user agent's cookie
       store by earliest last-access-time first.

   2.  Let _excessGlobalCookies_ be an empty list of cookies.

   3.  While _allCookies_'s size is greater than the user agent's total
       cookies limit:

       1.  Let _cookie_ be the first item of _allCookies_.

       2.  Remove _cookie_ from _allCookies_.

       3.  Remove _cookie_ from the user agent's cookie store.

       4.  Append _cookie_ to _excessGlobalCookies_.

   4.  Return _excessGlobalCookies_.

5.3.  Subcomponent Algorithms

   This section defines some algorithms used by user agents to process
   specific subcomponents of the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields.

5.3.1.  Parse a Date

   To *Parse a Date* given a byte sequence _input_, run these steps.
   They return a date and time or failure.

   Note that the various boolean flags defined as a part of the
   algorithm (i.e., found-time, found-day-of-month, found-month, found-
   year) are initially "not set".

   1.  Using the grammar below, divide the cookie-date into date-tokens.

      cookie-date     = *delimiter date-token-list *delimiter
      date-token-list = date-token *( 1*delimiter date-token )
      date-token      = 1*non-delimiter

      delimiter       = %x09 / %x20-2F / %x3B-40 / %x5B-60 / %x7B-7E
      non-delimiter   = %x00-08 / %x0A-1F / DIGIT / ":" / ALPHA
                        / %x7F-FF
      non-digit       = %x00-2F / %x3A-FF

      day-of-month    = 1*2DIGIT [ non-digit *OCTET ]
      month           = ( "jan" / "feb" / "mar" / "apr" /
                          "may" / "jun" / "jul" / "aug" /
                          "sep" / "oct" / "nov" / "dec" ) *OCTET
      year            = 2*4DIGIT [ non-digit *OCTET ]
      time            = hms-time [ non-digit *OCTET ]
      hms-time        = time-field ":" time-field ":" time-field
      time-field      = 1*2DIGIT

   2.  Process each date-token sequentially in the order the date-tokens
       appear in the cookie-date:

       1.  If the found-time flag is not set and the token matches the
           time production, set the found-time flag and set the hour-
           value, minute-value, and second-value to the numbers denoted
           by the digits in the date-token, respectively.  Skip the
           remaining sub-steps and continue to the next date-token.

       2.  If the found-day-of-month flag is not set and the date-token
           matches the day-of-month production, set the found-day-of-
           month flag and set the day-of-month-value to the number
           denoted by the date-token.  Skip the remaining sub-steps and
           continue to the next date-token.

       3.  If the found-month flag is not set and the date-token matches
           the month production, set the found-month flag and set the
           month-value to the month denoted by the date-token.  Skip the
           remaining sub-steps and continue to the next date-token.

       4.  If the found-year flag is not set and the date-token matches
           the year production, set the found-year flag and set the
           year-value to the number denoted by the date-token.  Skip the
           remaining sub-steps and continue to the next date-token.

   3.  If the year-value is greater than or equal to 70 and less than or
       equal to 99, increment the year-value by 1900.

   4.  If the year-value is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or
       equal to 69, increment the year-value by 2000.

       1.  NOTE: Some existing user agents interpret two-digit years
           differently.

   5.  If one of the following is true:

       *  at least one of the found-day-of-month, found-month, found-
          year, or found-time flags is not set,

       *  the day-of-month-value is less than 1 or greater than 31,

       *  the year-value is less than 1601,

       *  the hour-value is greater than 23,

       *  the minute-value is greater than 59, or

       *  the second-value is greater than 59,

       then return failure.

       (Note that leap seconds cannot be represented in this syntax.)

   6.  Let the parsed-cookie-date be the date whose day-of-month, month,
       year, hour, minute, and second (in UTC) are the day-of-month-
       value, the month-value, the year-value, the hour-value, the
       minute-value, and the second-value, respectively.  If no such
       date exists, abort these steps and fail to parse the cookie-date.

   7.  Return the parsed-cookie-date as the result of this algorithm.

5.3.2.  Domain Matching

   A host _host_ *Domain-Matches* a string _domainAttributeValue_ if at
   least one of the following is true:

   *  _host_ equals _domainAttributeValue_, or

   *  if all of the following are true:

      -  _host_ is a domain, and

      -  _host_ ends with the concatenation of U+002E (.) and
         _domainAttributeValue_.

5.3.3.  Cookie Default Path

   To determine the *Cookie Default Path*, given a URL path _path_, run
   these steps.  They return a URL path.

   1.  Assert: _path_ is a non-empty list.

   2.  If _path_'s size is greater than 1, then remove _path_'s last
       item.

   3.  Otherwise, set _path_[0] to the empty string.

   4.  Return _path_.

5.3.4.  Path Matching

   To determine if a URL path _requestPath_ *Path-Matches* a URL path
   _cookiePath_, run these steps.  They return a boolean.

   1.  Let _serializedRequestPath_ be the result of URL path serializing
       _requestPath_.

   2.  Let _serializedCookiePath_ be the result of URL path serializing
       _cookiePath_.

   3.  If _serializedCookiePath_ is _serializedRequestPath_, then return
       true.

   4.  If _serializedRequestPath_ starts with _serializedCookiePath_ and
       _serializedCookiePath_ ends with a U+002F (/), then return true.

   5.  Return whether the concatenation of _serializedRequestPath_
       followed by U+002F (/) starts with _serializedCookiePath_.

5.4.  Main Algorithms

5.4.1.  Parse and Store a Cookie

   To *Parse and Store a Cookie* given a byte sequence _input_, boolean
   _isSecure_, domain or IP address _host_, URL path _path_, boolean
   _httpOnlyAllowed_, boolean _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_,
   and boolean _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_:

   1.  Let _cookie_ be the result of running Parse a Cookie with
       _input_, _isSecure_, _host_, and _path_.

   2.  If _cookie_ is failure, then return.

   3.  Return the result of Store a Cookie given _cookie_, _isSecure_,
       _host_, _path_, _httpOnlyAllowed_,
       _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_, and
       _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_.

5.4.2.  Parse a Cookie

   To *Parse a Cookie* given a byte sequence _input_, boolean
   _isSecure_, host _host_, URL path _path_, run these steps.  They
   return a new cookie or failure:

   1.   If _input_ contains a byte in the range 0x00 to 0x08, inclusive,
        the range 0x0A to 0x1F inclusive, or 0x7F (CTL bytes excluding
        HTAB), then return failure.

   2.   Let _nameValueInput_ be null.

   3.   Let _attributesInput_ be the empty byte sequence.

   4.   If _input_ contains 0x3B (;), then set _nameValueInput_ to the
        bytes up to, but not including, the first 0x3B (;), and
        _attributesInput_ to the remainder of _input_ (including the
        0x3B (;) in question).

   5.   Otherwise, set _nameValueInput_ to _input_.

   6.   Assert: _nameValueInput_ is a byte sequence.

   7.   Let _name_ be null.

   8.   Let _value_ be null.

   9.   If _nameValueInput_ does not contain a 0x3D (=) character, then
        set _name_ to the empty byte sequence, and _value_ to
        _nameValueInput_.

   10.  Otherwise, set _name_ to the bytes up to, but not including, the
        first 0x3D (=), and set _value_ to the bytes after the first
        0x3D (=) (possibly being the empty byte sequence).

   11.  Remove any leading or trailing WSP bytes from _name_ and
        _value_.

   12.  If _name_'s length + _value_'s length is 0 or is greater than
        4096, then return failure.

   13.  Let _cookie_ be a new cookie whose name is _name_ and value is
        _value_.

   14.  Set _cookie_'s path to the result of running Cookie Default Path
        with _path_.

        Note: A Path attribute can override this.

   15.  While _attributesInput_ is not an empty byte sequence:

        1.   Let _maxAgeSeen_ be false.

        2.   Let _char_ be the result of consuming the first byte of
             _attributesInput_.

        3.   Assert: _char_ is 0x3B (;).

        4.   Let _attributeNameValueInput_ be null.

        5.   If _attributesInput_ contains 0x3B (;), then set
             _attributeNameValueInput_ to the result of consuming the
             bytes of _attributesInput_ up to, but not including, the
             first 0x3B (;).

        6.   Otherwise, set _attributeNameValueInput_ to the result of
             consuming the remainder of _attributesInput_.

        7.   Let _attributeName_ be null.

        8.   Let _attributeValue_ be the empty string.

        9.   If _attributeNameValueInput_ contains a 0x3D (=), then set
             _attributeName_ to the bytes up to, but not including, the
             first 0x3D (=) of _attributeNameValueInput_, and
             _attributeValue_ to the bytes after the first 0x3D (=) of
             _attributeNameValueInput_.

        10.  Otherwise, set _attributeName_ to
             _attributeNameValueInput_.

        11.  Remove any leading or trailing WSP bytes from
             _attributeName_ and _attributeValue_.

        12.  If _attributeValue_'s length is greater than 1024, then
             continue.

        13.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             Expires:

             1.  If _maxAgeSeen_ is true, then continue.

             2.  Let _expiryTime_ be the result of running Parse a Date
                 given _attributeValue_.

             3.  If _attributeValue_ is failure, then continue.

             4.  If _expiryTime_ is greater than the current time and
                 date + the user agent's cookie age limit, then set
                 _expiryTime_ to the user agent's cookie age limit.

             5.  If _expiryTime_ is earlier than the earliest date the
                 user agent can represent, the user agent MAY replace
                 _expiryTime_ with the earliest representable date.

             6.  Set _cookie_'s expiry-time to _expiryTime_.

        14.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             Max-Age:

             1.  If _attributeValue_ is empty, continue.

             2.  If the first byte of _attributeValue_ is neither a
                 DIGIT, nor 0x2D (-) followed by a DIGIT, then continue.

             3.  If the remainder of _attributeValue_ contains a non-
                 DIGIT, then continue.

             4.  Let _deltaSeconds_ be _attributeValue_, converted to a
                 base 10 integer.

             5.  Set _deltaSeconds_ to the smaller of _deltaSeconds_ and
                 the user agent's cookie age limit, in seconds.

             6.  If _deltaSeconds_ is less than or equal to 0, let
                 _expiryTime_ be the earliest representable date and
                 time.  Otherwise, let _expiryTime_ be the current date
                 and time + _deltaSeconds_ seconds.

             7.  Set _cookie_'s expiry-time to _expiryTime_.

             8.  Set _maxAgeSeen_ to true.

        15.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             Domain:

             1.  Let _host_ be failure.

             2.  If _attributeValue_ contains only ASCII bytes:

                 1.  Let _hostInput_ be _attributeValue_, ASCII decoded.

                 2.  If _hostInput_ starts with U+002E (.), then set
                     _hostInput_ to _hostInput_ without its leading
                     U+002E (.).

                 3.  Set _host_ to the result of host parsing
                     _hostInput_.

             3.  Set _cookie_'s host to _host_.

        16.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             Path:

             1.  If _attributeValue_ is not empty and if the first byte
                 of _attributeValue_ is 0x2F (/), then:

                 1.  Set _cookie_'s path to _attributeValue_ split on
                     0x2F (/).

                 2.  Set _cookie_'s has-path attribute to true.

        17.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             Secure:

             1.  Set _cookie_'s secure to true.

        18.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             HttpOnly:

             1.  Set _cookie_'s http-only to true.

        19.  If _attributeName_ is a byte-case-insensitive match for
             SameSite:

             1.  If _attributeValue_ is a byte-case-insensitive match
                 for None, then set _cookie_'s same-site to "none".

             2.  If _attributeValue_ is a byte-case-insensitive match
                 for Strict, then set _cookie_'s same-site to "strict".

             3.  If _attributeValue_ is a byte-case-insensitive match
                 for Lax, then set _cookie_'s same-site to "lax".

   16.  Return _cookie_.

   Note: Attributes with an unrecognized _attributeName_ are ignored.

   Note: This intentionally overrides earlier cookie attributes so that
   generally the last specified cookie attribute "wins".

5.4.3.  Store a Cookie

   To *Store a Cookie* given a cookie _cookie_, boolean _isSecure_,
   domain or IP address _host_, boolean _httpOnlyAllowed_, boolean
   _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_, and boolean
   _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_:

   1.   Assert: _cookie_'s name's length + _cookie_'s value's length is
        not 0 or greater than 4096.

   2.   Assert: _cookie_'s name does not contain a byte in the range
        0x00 to 0x08, inclusive, in the range 0x0A to 0x1F, inclusive,
        or 0x7F (CTL characters excluding HTAB).

   3.   If _cookie_'s host is failure, then return null.

   4.   Set _cookie_'s creation-time and last-access-time to the current
        date and time.

   5.   If _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_ is false and
        _cookie_'s host is a public suffix:

        1.  If _cookie_'s host is host-equal to _host_, then set
            _cookie_'s host to null.

        2.  Otherwise, return null.

        Note: This step prevents attacker.example from disrupting the
        integrity of site.example by setting a cookie with a Domain
        attribute of example.  In the event the end user navigates
        directly to example, a cookie can still be set and will forcibly
        have its host-only set to true.

   6.   If _cookie_'s host is null:

        1.  Set _cookie_'s host-only to true.

        2.  Set _cookie_'s host to _host_.

   7.   Otherwise:

        1.  If _host_ does not Domain-Match _cookie_'s host, then return
            null.

        2.  Set _cookie_'s host-only to false.

   8.   Assert: _cookie_'s host is a domain or IP address.

   9.   If _httpOnlyAllowed_ is false and _cookie_'s http-only is true,
        then return null.

   10.  If _isSecure_ is false:

        1.  If _cookie_'s secure is true, then return null.

        2.  If the user agent's cookie store contains at least one
            cookie _existingCookie_ that meets all of the following
            criteria:

            1.  _existingCookie_'s name is _cookie_'s name;

            2.  _existingCookie_'s secure is true;

            3.  _existingCookie_'s host Domain-Matches _cookie_'s host,
                or vice-versa; and

            4.  _cookie_'s path Path-Matches _existingCookie_'s path,

            then return null.

            Note: The path comparison is not symmetric, ensuring only
            that a newly-created, non-secure cookie does not overlay an
            existing secure cookie, providing some mitigation against
            cookie-fixing attacks.  That is, given an existing secure
            cookie named 'a' with a path of '/login', a non-secure
            cookie named 'a' could be set for a path of '/' or '/foo',
            but not for a path of '/login' or '/login/en'.

   11.  If _cookie_'s same-site is not "none" and
        _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_ is false, then return null.

   12.  If _cookie_'s same-site is "none" and _cookie_'s secure is
        false, then return null.

   13.  If _cookie_'s name, byte-lowercased, starts with __secure- and
        _cookie_'s secure is false, then return null.

        Note: The check here and those below are with a byte-lowercased
        value in order to protect servers that process these values in a
        case-insensitive manner.

   14.  If _cookie_'s name, byte-lowercased, starts with __host- and
        _cookie_ is not Host-prefix compatible, then return null.

   15.  If _cookie_'s name, byte-lowercased, starts with __http- and
        _cookie_ is not Http-prefix compatible, then return null.

   16.  If _cookie_'s name, byte-lowercased, starts with __hosthttp- and
        _cookie_ is not both Host-prefix compatible and Http-prefix
        compatible, then return null.

   17.  If _cookie_'s name is the empty byte sequence and one of the
        following is true:

        *  _cookie_'s value, byte-lowercased, starts with __secure-,

        *  _cookie_'s value, byte-lowercased, starts with __host-,

        *  _cookie_'s value, byte-lowercased, starts with __http-, or

        *  _cookie_'s value, byte-lowercased, starts with __hosthttp-,

        then return null.

   18.  If the user agent's cookie store contains a cookie _oldCookie_
        whose name is _cookie_'s name, host is host-equal to _cookie_'s
        host, host-only is _cookie_'s host-only, and path is path-equal
        to _cookie_'s path:

        1.  If _httpOnlyAllowed_ is false and _oldCookie_'s http-only is
            true, then return null.

        2.  If _cookie_'s secure is equal to _oldCookie_'s secure,
            _cookie_'s same-site is equal to _oldCookie_'s same-site,
            and _cookie_'s expiry-time is equal to _oldCookie_'s expiry-
            time, then return null.

        3.  Set _cookie_'s creation-time to _oldCookie_'s creation-time.

        4.  Remove _oldCookie_ from the user agent's cookie store.

        Note: This algorithm maintains the invariant that there is at
        most one such cookie.

   19.  Insert _cookie_ into the user agent's cookie store.

   20.  Return _cookie_.

5.4.4.  Garbage Collect Cookies

   To *Garbage Collect Cookies* given a host _host_:

   1.  Let _expiredCookies_ be the result of running Remove Expired
       Cookies.

   2.  Let _excessHostCookies_ be the result of running Remove Excess
       Cookies for Host given _host_.

   3.  Let _excessGlobalCookies_ be the result of running Remove Global
       Excess Cookies.

   4.  Let _removedCookies_ be « ».

   5.  For each _cookieList_ of « _expiredCookies_, _excessHostCookies_,
       _excessGlobalCookies_ », do the following:

       1.  Extend _removedCookies_ with _cookieList_.

   6.  Return _removedCookies_

5.4.5.  Retrieve Cookies

   To *Retrieve Cookies* given a boolean _isSecure_, host _host_, URL
   path _path_, boolean _httpOnlyAllowed_, and string _sameSite_:

   1.  Assert: _sameSite_ is "strict-or-less", "lax-or-less", "unset-or-
       less", or "none".

   2.  Let _cookies_ be all cookies from the user agent's cookie store
       that meet these conditions:

       *  One of the following is true:

          -  cookie's host-only is true and _host_ is host-equal to
             cookie's host, or

          -  cookie's host-only is false and _host_ Domain-Matches
             cookie's host.

          It's possible that the public suffix list changed since a
          cookie was created.  If this change results in a cookie's host
          becoming a public suffix and the cookie's host-only is false,
          then that cookie SHOULD NOT be returned.

          XXX: We should probably move this requirement out-of-bound as
          this invalidation should happen as part of updating the public
          suffixes.

       *  _path_ Path-Matches cookie's path.

       *  One of the following is true:

          -  cookie's secure is true and _isSecure_ is true, or

          -  cookie's secure is false.

       *  One of the following is true:

          -  cookie's http-only is true and _httpOnlyAllowed_ is true,
             or

          -  cookie's http-only is false.

       *  One of the following is true:

          -  cookie's same-site is "strict" and _sameSite_ is "strict-
             or-less";

          -  cookie's same-site is "lax" and _sameSite_ is one of
             "strict-or-less" or "lax-or-less";

          -  cookie's same-site is "unset" and _sameSite_ is one of
             "strict-or-less", "lax-or-less", or "unset-or-less"; or

          -  cookie's same-site is "none".

   3.  Sort _cookies_ in the following order:

       *  Cookies whose path's size is greater are listed before cookies
          whose path's size is smaller.

       *  Among cookies whose path's size is equal, cookies whose
          creation-time is earlier are listed before cookies whose
          creation-time is later.

   4.  Set the last-access-time of each cookie of _cookies_ to the
       current date and time and reflect these changes in the user
       agent's cookie store.

   5.  Return _cookies_.

5.4.6.  Serialize Cookies

   To *Serialize Cookies* given a list of cookies _cookies_:

   1.  Let _output_ be an empty byte sequence.

   2.  For each _cookie_ of _cookies_:

       1.  If _output_ is not the empty byte sequence, then append 0x3B
           (;) followed by 0x20 (SP) to _output_.

       2.  If _cookie_'s name is not the empty byte sequence, then
           append _cookie_'s name followed by 0x3D (=) to _output_.

       3.  Append _cookie_'s value to _output_.

   3.  Return _output_.

5.5.  Requirements Specific to Non-Browser User Agents

5.5.1.  The Set-Cookie Header Field

   When a user agent receives a Set-Cookie header field in an HTTP
   response, the user agent MAY ignore the Set-Cookie header field in
   its entirety as per its cookie policy (see Section 7.2).

   User agents MAY ignore Set-Cookie header fields contained in
   responses with 100-level status codes.

   Set-Cookie header fields contained in responses with non-100-level
   status codes (including those in responses with 400- and 500-level
   status codes) SHOULD be processed as follows:

   1.  Let _isSecure_ be a boolean indicating whether request's URL's
       scheme is deemed secure, in an implementation-defined manner.

   2.  Let _host_ be request's host.

   3.  Let _path_ be request's URL's path.

   4.  Let _httpOnlyAllowed_ be true.

   5.  Let _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_ be a boolean whose
       value is implementation-defined.

   6.  Let _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_ be a boolean whose value is
       implementation-defined.

   7.  Let _cookie_ be the result of running Parse and Store a Cookie
       given the header field value, _isSecure_, _host_, _path_,
       _httpOnlyAllowed_, _allowNonHostOnlyCookieForPublicSuffix_, and
       _sameSiteStrictOrLaxAllowed_.

   8.  If _cookie_ is null, then return.

   9.  Run Garbage Collect Cookies given _cookie_'s host.

5.5.2.  The Cookie Header Field

   The user agent includes stored cookies in the Cookie request header
   field.

   When the user agent generates an HTTP request, the user agent MUST
   NOT attach more than one Cookie header field.

   A user agent MAY omit the Cookie header field in its entirety.

   If the user agent does attach a Cookie header field to an HTTP
   request, the user agent MUST compute its value as follows:

   1.  Let _isSecure_ be a boolean indicating whether request's URL's
       scheme is deemed secure, in an implementation-defined manner.

   2.  Let _host_ be request's host.

   3.  Let _path_ be request's URL's path.

   4.  Let _httpOnlyAllowed_ be true.

   5.  Let _sameSite_ be a string whose value is implementation-defined,
       but has to be one of "strict-or-less", "lax-or-less", "unset-or-
       less", or "none".

   6.  Let _cookies_ be the result of running Retrieve Cookies given
       _isSecure_, _host_, _path_, _httpOnlyAllowed_, and _sameSite_.

   7.  Return the result of running Serialize Cookies given _cookies_.

   Note: Previous versions of this specification required that only one
   Cookie header field be sent in requests.  This is no longer a
   requirement.  While this specification requires that a single cookie-
   string be produced, some user agents may split that string across
   multiple Cookie header fields.  For examples, see Section 8.2.3 of
   [RFC9113] and Section 4.2.1 of [HTTP].

5.5.3.  Cookie Store Eviction for Non-Browser User Agents

   The user agent SHOULD evict all expired cookies from its cookie store
   if, at any time, an expired cookie exists in the cookie store, by
   calling Remove Expired Cookies.

   When "the current session is over" (as defined by the user agent),
   the user agent MUST remove from the cookie store all cookies whose
   expiry-time is null.

5.6.  Requirements Specific to Browser User Agents

   While browsers are expected to generally follow the same model as
   non-browser user agents, they have additional complexity due to the
   document model (and the ability to nest documents) that is considered
   out-of-scope for this specification.

   Specifications for such a user agent are expected to build upon the
   following algorithms and invoke them appropriately to process Cookie
   and Set-Cookie header fields, as well as manipulating the user
   agent's cookie store through non-HTTP APIs:

   *  Parse and Store a Cookie

   *  Store a Cookie

   *  Remove Expired Cookies

   *  Garbage Collect Cookies

   *  Retrieve Cookies

   *  Serialize Cookies

   This provides the flexibility browsers need to detail their
   requirements in considerable detail.

6.  Implementation Considerations

6.1.  Limits

   Servers SHOULD use as few and as small cookies as possible to avoid
   reaching these implementation limits, minimize network bandwidth due
   to the Cookie header field being included in every request, and to
   avoid reaching server header field limits (See Section 4.2.1).

   Servers SHOULD gracefully degrade if the user agent fails to return
   one or more cookies in the Cookie header field because the user agent
   might evict any cookie at any time.

6.2.  Application Programming Interfaces

   One reason the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields use such esoteric
   syntax is that many platforms (both in servers and user agents)
   provide a string-based application programming interface (API) to
   cookies, requiring application-layer programmers to generate and
   parse the syntax used by the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields,
   which many programmers have done incorrectly, resulting in
   interoperability problems.

   Instead of providing string-based APIs to cookies, platforms would be
   well-served by providing more semantic APIs.  It is beyond the scope
   of this document to recommend specific API designs, but there are
   clear benefits to accepting an abstract "Date" object instead of a
   serialized date string.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   Cookies' primary privacy risk is their ability to correlate user
   activity.  This can happen on a single site, but is most problematic
   when activity is tracked across different, seemingly unconnected Web
   sites to build a user profile.

   Over time, this capability (warned against explicitly in [RFC2109]
   and all of its successors) has become widely used for varied reasons
   including:

   *  authenticating users across sites,

   *  assembling information on users,

   *  protecting against fraud and other forms of undesirable traffic,

   *  targeting advertisements at specific users or at users with
      specified attributes,

   *  measuring how often ads are shown to users, and

   *  recognizing when an ad resulted in a change in user behavior.

   While not every use of cookies is necessarily problematic for
   privacy, their potential for abuse has become a widespread concern in
   the Internet community and broader society.  In response to these
   concerns, user agents have actively constrained cookie functionality
   in various ways (as allowed and encouraged by previous
   specifications), while avoiding disruption to features they judge
   desirable for the health of the Web.

   It is too early to declare consensus on which specific mechanism(s)
   should be used to mitigate cookies' privacy impact; user agents'
   ongoing changes to how they are handled are best characterised as
   experiments that can provide input into that eventual consensus.

   Instead, this document describes limited, general mitigations against
   the privacy risks associated with cookies that enjoy wide deployment
   at the time of writing.  It is expected that implementations will
   continue to experiment and impose stricter, more well-defined
   limitations on cookies over time.  Future versions of this document
   might codify those mechanisms based upon deployment experience.  If
   functions that currently rely on cookies can be supported by
   separate, targeted mechanisms, they might be documented in separate
   specifications and stricter limitations on cookies might become
   feasible.

   Note that cookies are not the only mechanism that can be used to
   track users across sites, so while these mitigations are necessary to
   improve Web privacy, they are not sufficient on their own.

7.1.  Third-Party Cookies

   A "third-party" or cross-site cookie is one that is associated with
   embedded content (such as scripts, images, stylesheets, frames) that
   is obtained from a different server than the one that hosts the
   primary resource (usually, the Web page that the user is viewing).
   Third-party cookies are often used to correlate users' activity on
   different sites.

   Because of their inherent privacy issues, most user agents now limit
   third-party cookies in a variety of ways.  Some completely block
   third-party cookies by refusing to process third-party Set-Cookie
   header fields and refusing to send third-party Cookie header fields.
   Some partition cookies based upon the first-party context, so that
   different cookies are sent depending on the site being browsed.  Some
   block cookies based upon user agent cookie policy and/or user
   controls.

   While this document does not endorse or require a specific approach,
   it is RECOMMENDED that user agents adopt a policy for third-party
   cookies that is as restrictive as compatibility constraints permit.
   Consequently, resources cannot rely upon third-party cookies being
   treated consistently by user agents for the foreseeable future.

7.2.  Cookie Policy

   User agents MAY enforce a cookie policy consisting of restrictions on
   how cookies may be used or ignored (see Section 5.5.1).

   A cookie policy may govern which domains or parties, as in first and
   third parties (see Section 7.1), for which the user agent will allow
   cookie access.  The policy can also define limits on cookie size,
   cookie expiry (see Section 4.1.2.1 and Section 4.1.2.2), and the
   number of cookies per domain or in total.

   The goal of a restrictive cookie policy is often to improve security
   or privacy.  User agents often allow users to change the cookie
   policy (see Section 7.3).

7.3.  User Controls

   User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for managing the
   cookies stored in the cookie store.  For example, a user agent might
   let users delete all cookies received during a specified time period
   or all the cookies related to a particular domain.  In addition, many
   user agents include a user interface element that lets users examine
   the cookies stored in their cookie store.

   User agents SHOULD provide users with a mechanism for disabling
   cookies.  When cookies are disabled, the user agent MUST NOT include
   a Cookie header field in outbound HTTP requests and the user agent
   MUST NOT process Set-Cookie header fields in inbound HTTP responses.

   User agents MAY offer a way to change the cookie policy (see
   Section 7.2).

   User agents MAY provide users the option of preventing persistent
   storage of cookies across sessions.  When configured thusly, user
   agents MUST treat all received cookies as if their expiry-time is
   null.

7.4.  Expiration Dates

   Although servers can set the expiration date for cookies to the
   distant future, most user agents do not actually retain cookies for
   multiple decades.  Rather than choosing gratuitously long expiration
   periods, servers SHOULD promote user privacy by selecting reasonable
   cookie expiration periods based on the purpose of the cookie.  For
   example, a typical session identifier might reasonably be set to
   expire in two weeks.

8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Overview

   Cookies have a number of security pitfalls.  This section overviews a
   few of the more salient issues.

   In particular, cookies encourage developers to rely on ambient
   authority for authentication, often becoming vulnerable to attacks
   such as cross-site request forgery [CSRF].  Also, when storing
   session identifiers in cookies, developers often create session
   fixation vulnerabilities.

   Transport-layer encryption, such as that employed in HTTPS, is
   insufficient to prevent a network attacker from obtaining or altering
   a victim's cookies because the cookie protocol itself has various
   vulnerabilities (see "Weak Confidentiality" and "Weak Integrity",
   below).  In addition, by default, cookies do not provide
   confidentiality or integrity from network attackers, even when used
   in conjunction with HTTPS.

8.2.  Ambient Authority

   A server that uses cookies to authenticate users can suffer security
   vulnerabilities because some user agents let remote parties issue
   HTTP requests from the user agent (e.g., via HTTP redirects or HTML
   forms).  When issuing those requests, user agents attach cookies even
   if the remote party does not know the contents of the cookies,
   potentially letting the remote party exercise authority at an unwary
   server.

   Although this security concern goes by a number of names (e.g.,
   cross-site request forgery, confused deputy), the issue stems from
   cookies being a form of ambient authority.  Cookies encourage server
   operators to separate designation (in the form of URLs) from
   authorization (in the form of cookies).  Consequently, the user agent
   might supply the authorization for a resource designated by the
   attacker, possibly causing the server or its clients to undertake
   actions designated by the attacker as though they were authorized by
   the user.

   Instead of using cookies for authorization, server operators might
   wish to consider entangling designation and authorization by treating
   URLs as capabilities.  Instead of storing secrets in cookies, this
   approach stores secrets in URLs, requiring the remote entity to
   supply the secret itself.  Although this approach is not a panacea,
   judicious application of these principles can lead to more robust
   security.

8.3.  Clear Text

   Unless sent over a secure channel (such as TLS [TLS13]), the
   information in the Cookie and Set-Cookie header fields is transmitted
   in the clear.

   1.  All sensitive information conveyed in these header fields is
       exposed to an eavesdropper.

   2.  A malicious intermediary could alter the header fields as they
       travel in either direction, with unpredictable results.

   3.  A malicious client could alter the Cookie header fields before
       transmission, with unpredictable results.

   Servers SHOULD encrypt and sign the contents of cookies (using
   whatever format the server desires) when transmitting them to the
   user agent (even when sending the cookies over a secure channel).
   However, encrypting and signing cookie contents does not prevent an
   attacker from transplanting a cookie from one user agent to another
   or from replaying the cookie at a later time.

   In addition to encrypting and signing the contents of every cookie,
   servers that require a higher level of security SHOULD use the Cookie
   and Set-Cookie header fields only over a secure channel.  When using
   cookies over a secure channel, servers SHOULD set the Secure
   attribute (see Section 4.1.2.5) for every cookie.  If a server does
   not set the Secure attribute, the protection provided by the secure
   channel will be largely moot.

   For example, consider a webmail server that stores a session
   identifier in a cookie and is typically accessed over HTTPS.  If the
   server does not set the Secure attribute on its cookies, an active
   network attacker can intercept any outbound HTTP request from the
   user agent and redirect that request to the webmail server over HTTP.
   Even if the webmail server is not listening for HTTP connections, the
   user agent will still include cookies in the request.  The active
   network attacker can intercept these cookies, replay them against the
   server, and learn the contents of the user's email.  If, instead, the
   server had set the Secure attribute on its cookies, the user agent
   would not have included the cookies in the clear-text request.

8.4.  Session Identifiers

   Instead of storing session information directly in a cookie (where it
   might be exposed to or replayed by an attacker), servers commonly
   store a nonce (or "session identifier") in a cookie.  When the server
   receives an HTTP request with a nonce, the server can look up state
   information associated with the cookie using the nonce as a key.

   Using session identifier cookies limits the damage an attacker can
   cause if the attacker learns the contents of a cookie because the
   nonce is useful only for interacting with the server (unlike non-
   nonce cookie content, which might itself be sensitive).  Furthermore,
   using a single nonce prevents an attacker from "splicing" together
   cookie content from two interactions with the server, which could
   cause the server to behave unexpectedly.

   Using session identifiers is not without risk.  For example, the
   server SHOULD take care to avoid "session fixation" vulnerabilities.
   A session fixation attack proceeds in three steps.  First, the
   attacker transplants a session identifier from his or her user agent
   to the victim's user agent.  Second, the victim uses that session
   identifier to interact with the server, possibly imbuing the session
   identifier with the user's credentials or confidential information.
   Third, the attacker uses the session identifier to interact with
   server directly, possibly obtaining the user's authority or
   confidential information.

8.5.  Weak Confidentiality

   Cookies do not provide isolation by port.  If a cookie is readable by
   a service running on one port, the cookie is also readable by a
   service running on another port of the same server.  If a cookie is
   writable by a service on one port, the cookie is also writable by a
   service running on another port of the same server.  For this reason,
   servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually distrusting services on
   different ports of the same host and use cookies to store security-
   sensitive information.

   Cookies do not provide isolation by scheme.  Although most commonly
   used with the http and https schemes, the cookies for a given host
   might also be available to other schemes, such as ftp and gopher.
   Although this lack of isolation by scheme is most apparent in non-
   HTTP APIs that permit access to cookies (e.g., HTML's document.cookie
   API), the lack of isolation by scheme is actually present in
   requirements for processing cookies themselves (e.g., consider
   retrieving a URI with the gopher scheme via HTTP).

   Cookies do not always provide isolation by path.  Although the
   network-level protocol does not send cookies stored for one path to
   another, some user agents expose cookies via non-HTTP APIs, such as
   HTML's document.cookie API.  Because some of these user agents (e.g.,
   web browsers) do not isolate resources received from different paths,
   a resource retrieved from one path might be able to access cookies
   stored for another path.

8.6.  Weak Integrity

   Cookies do not provide integrity guarantees for sibling domains (and
   their subdomains).  For example, consider foo.site.example and
   bar.site.example.  The foo.site.example server can set a cookie with
   a Domain attribute of "site.example" (possibly overwriting an
   existing "site.example" cookie set by bar.site.example), and the user
   agent will include that cookie in HTTP requests to bar.site.example.
   In the worst case, bar.site.example will be unable to distinguish
   this cookie from a cookie it set itself.  The foo.site.example server
   might be able to leverage this ability to mount an attack against
   bar.site.example.

   Even though the Set-Cookie header field supports the Path attribute,
   the Path attribute does not provide any integrity protection because
   the user agent will accept an arbitrary Path attribute in a Set-
   Cookie header field.  For example, an HTTP response to a request for
   http://site.example/foo/bar can set a cookie with a Path attribute of
   "/qux".  Consequently, servers SHOULD NOT both run mutually
   distrusting services on different paths of the same host and use
   cookies to store security-sensitive information.

   An active network attacker can also inject cookies into the Cookie
   header field sent to https://site.example/ by impersonating a
   response from http://site.example/ and injecting a Set-Cookie header
   field.  The HTTPS server at site.example will be unable to
   distinguish these cookies from cookies that it set itself in an HTTPS
   response.  An active network attacker might be able to leverage this
   ability to mount an attack against site.example even if site.example
   uses HTTPS exclusively.

   Servers can partially mitigate these attacks by encrypting and
   signing the contents of their cookies, or by naming the cookie with
   the __Secure- prefix.  However, using cryptography does not mitigate
   the issue completely because an attacker can replay a cookie he or
   she received from the authentic site.example server in the user's
   session, with unpredictable results.

   Finally, an attacker might be able to force the user agent to delete
   cookies by storing a large number of cookies.  Once the user agent
   reaches its storage limit, the user agent will be forced to evict
   some cookies.  Servers SHOULD NOT rely upon user agents retaining
   cookies.

8.7.  Reliance on DNS

   Cookies rely upon the Domain Name System (DNS) for security.  If the
   DNS is partially or fully compromised, the cookie protocol might fail
   to provide the security properties required by applications.

8.8.  SameSite Cookies

   SameSite cookies offer a robust defense against CSRF attack when
   deployed in strict mode, and when supported by the client.  It is,
   however, prudent to ensure that this designation is not the extent of
   a site's defense against CSRF, as same-site navigations and
   submissions can certainly be executed in conjunction with other
   attack vectors such as cross-site scripting.

   Developers are strongly encouraged to deploy the usual server-side
   defenses (CSRF tokens, ensuring that "safe" HTTP methods are
   idempotent, etc) to mitigate the risk more fully.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Cookie

   The HTTP Field Name Registry (see [HttpFieldNameRegistry]) needs to
   be updated with the following registration:

   Header field name:  Cookie

   Applicable protocol:  http

   Status:  standard

   Author/Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document:  this specification (Section 5.5.2)

9.2.  Set-Cookie

   The HTTP Field Name Registry (see [HttpFieldNameRegistry]) needs to
   be updated with the following registration:

   Header field name:  Set-Cookie

   Applicable protocol:  http

   Status:  standard

   Author/Change controller:  IETF

   Specification document:  this specification (Section 5.5.1)

10.  Changes

   Revamped the document to allow for more detailed requirements on
   browsers in downstream specifications.
