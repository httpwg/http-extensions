--- abstract

Existing HTTP authentication schemes are probeable in the sense that it is
possible for an unauthenticated client to probe whether an origin serves
resources that require authentication. It is possible for an origin to hide the
fact that it requires authentication by not generating Unauthorized status
codes, however that only works with non-cryptographic authentication schemes:
cryptographic signatures require a fresh nonce to be signed, and there is no
existing way for the origin to share such a nonce without exposing the fact
that it serves resources that require authentication. This document proposes a
new non-probeable cryptographic authentication scheme.

# Introduction {#introduction}

HTTP authentication schemes (see {{Section 11 of !HTTP=RFC9110}}) allow origins
to restrict access for some resources to only authenticated requests. While
these schemes commonly involve a challenge where the origin asks the client to
provide authentication information, it is possible for clients to send such
information unprompted. This is particularly useful in cases where an origin
wants to offer a service or capability only to "those who know" while all
others are given no indication the service or capability exists. Such designs
rely on an externally-defined mechanism by which keys are distributed. For
example, a company might offer remote employee access to company services
directly via its website using their employee credentials, or offer access to
limited special capabilities for specific employees, while making discovering
(probing for) such capabilities difficult. Members of less well-defined
communities might use more ephemeral keys to acquire access to geography- or
capability-specific resources, as issued by an entity whose user base is larger
than the available resources can support (by having that entity metering the
availability of keys temporally or geographically).

While digital-signature-based HTTP authentication schemes already exist
({{?HOBA=RFC7486}}), they rely on the origin explicitly sending a fresh
challenge to the client, to ensure that the signature input is fresh. That
makes the origin probeable as it send the challenge to unauthenticated clients.
This document defines a new signature-based authentication scheme that is not
probeable.

## Conventions and Definitions {#conventions}

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the notation from {{Section 1.3 of !QUIC=RFC9000}}.

# The Signature Authentication Scheme

This document defines the "Signature" HTTP authentication scheme. It uses
asymmetric cryptography. User agents possess a key ID and a public/private key
pair, and origin servers maintain a mapping of authorized key IDs to their
associated public keys.

The client uses a TLS keying material exporter to generate data to be signed
(see {{compute-proof}}) then sends the signature using the Authorization or
Proxy-Authorization header field. The signature and additional information are
exchanged using authentication parameters (see {{auth-params}}).

# TLS Usage

This authentication scheme is only defined for uses of HTTP with TLS
{{!TLS=RFC8446}}. This includes any use of HTTP over TLS as typically used for
HTTP/2 {{H2}}, or HTTP/3 {{H3}} where the transport protocol uses TLS as its
authentication and key exchange mechanism {{?QUIC-TLS=RFC9001}}.

Because the TLS keying material exporter is only secure for authentication when
it is uniquely bound to the TLS session {{!RFC7627}}, the Signature
authentication scheme requires either one of the following properties:

* The TLS version in use is greater or equal to 1.3 {{TLS}}.

* The TLS version in use is 1.2 and the Extended Master Secret extension
  {{RFC7627}} has been negotiated.

Clients MUST NOT use the Signature authentication scheme on connections that do
not meet one of the two properties above. If a server receives a request that
uses this authentication scheme on a connection that meets neither of the above
properties, the server MUST treat the request as malformed.

# Computing the Authentication Proof {#compute-proof}

The user agent computes the authentication proof using a TLS keying material
exporter {{!KEY-EXPORT=RFC5705}} with the following parameters:

* the label is set to "EXPORTER-HTTP-Signature-Authentication"

* the context is set to the structure described in {{context}}

* the exporter output length is set to 48 bytes (see {{output}})

## Key Exporter Context {#context}

The TLS key exporter context is described in {{fig-context}}:

~~~
  Signature Algorithm (16),
  Key ID Length (i),
  Key ID (..),
  Public Key Length (i),
  Public Key (..),
  Scheme Length (i),
  Scheme (..),
  Host Length (i),
  Host (..),
  Port (16),
  Realm Length (i),
  Realm (..),
~~~
{: #fig-context title="Key Exporter Context Format"}

The key exporter context contains the following fields:

Signature Algorithm:

: The signature scheme sent in the `p` Parameter (see {{parameter-s}}).

Key ID:

: The key ID sent in the `k` Parameter (see {{parameter-k}}).

Public Key:

: The public key used by the server to validate the signature provided by the
client (the encoding is described below).

Scheme:

: The scheme for this request, encoded using the format of the scheme portion
of a URI as defined in {{Section 3.1 of !URI=RFC3986}}.

Host:

: The host for this request, encoded using the format of the host portion of a
URI as defined in {{Section 3.2.2 of URI}}.

Port:

: The port for this request.

Realm:

: The real of authentication that is sent in the realm authentication parameter
({{Section 11.5 of HTTP}}). If the realm authentication parameter is not
present, this SHALL be empty. This document does not define a means for the
origin to communicate a realm to the client. If a client is not configured to
use a specific realm, it SHALL use an empty realm and SHALL NOT send the realm
authentication parameter.

The Signature Algorithm and Port fields are encoded as unsigned 16-bit integers
in network byte order. The Key ID, Public Key, Scheme, Host, and Real fields
are length prefixed strings; they are preceded by a Length field that
represents their length in bytes. These length fields are encoded using the
variable-length integer encoding from {{Section 16 of QUIC}} and MUST be
encoded in the minimum number of bytes necessary.

The encoding of the public key is determined by the Signature Algorithm in use
as follows:

RSASSA-PSS algorithms:

: The public key is an RSAPublicKey structure {{!PKCS1=RFC8017}} encoded in DER
{{X.690}}. BER encodings which are not DER MUST be rejected.

ECDSA algorithms:

: The public key is a UncompressedPointRepresentation structure defined in
{{Section 4.2.8.2 of TLS}}, using the curve specified by the SignatureScheme.

EdDSA algorithms:

: The public key is the byte string encoding defined in {{!EdDSA=RFC8032}}.

This document does not define the public key encodings for other algorithms. In
order for a SignatureScheme to be usable with the Signature HTTP authentication
scheme, its public key encoding needs to be defined in a corresponding document.

## Key Exporter Output {#output}

The key exporter output is 48 bytes long. Of those, the first 32 bytes are part
of the input to the signature and the next 16 bytes are sent alongside the
signature. This allows the recipient to confirm that the exporter produces the
right values. This is described in {{fig-output}}:

~~~
  Signature Input (256),
  Verification (128),
~~~
{: #fig-output title="Key Exporter Output Format"}

The key exporter context contains the following fields:

Signature Input:

: This is part of the data signed using the client's chosen asymmetric private
key (see {{computation}}).

Verification:

: The verification is transmitted to the server using the v Parameter (see
{{parameter-v}}).

## Signature Computation {#computation}

Once the Signature Input has been extracted from the key exporter output (see
{{output}}), it is prefixed with static data before being signed to mitigate
issues caused by key reuse. The signature is computed over the concatenation of:

* A string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times

* The context string "HTTP Signature Authentication"

* A single 0 byte which serves as a separator

* The Signature Input extracted from the key exporter output (see {{output}})

For example, if the Signature Input has all its 32 bytes set to 01, the content
covered by the signature (in hexadecimal format) would be:

~~~
2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020
2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020
48545450205369676E61747572652041757468656E7469636174696F6E
00
0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101
~~~
{: #fig-sig-example title="Example Content Covered by Signature"}

This constructions mirrors that of the TLS 1.3 CertificateVerify message
defined in {{Section 4.4.3 of TLS}}.

The resulting signature is then transmitted to the server using the `p`
Parameter (see {{parameter-p}}).

# Authentication Parameters {#auth-params}

This specification defines the following authentication parameters.

All of the byte sequences below are encoded using base64url (see {{Section 5 of
!BASE64=RFC4648}}) without quotes and without padding. In other words, these
byte sequence authentication parameters values MUST NOT include any characters
other then ASCII letters, digits, dash and underscore.

The integer below is encoded without a minus and without leading zeroes. In
other words, the integer authentication parameters value MUST NOT include any
characters other than digits, and MUST NOT start with a zero unless the full
value is "0".

Using the syntax from {{!ABNF=RFC5234}}:

~~~
signature-byte-sequence-param-value = *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "_" )
signature-integer-param-value =  %x31-39 1*4( DIGIT ) / "0"
~~~
{: #fig-param title="Authentication Parameter Value ABNF"}

## The k Parameter {#parameter-k}

The REQUIRED "k" (key ID) parameter is a byte sequence that identifies which key
the user agent wishes to use to authenticate. This can for example be used to
point to an entry into a server-side database of known keys.

## The a Parameter {#parameter-a}

The REQUIRED "a" (public key) parameter is a byte sequence that contains the
public key used by the server to validate the signature provided by the client.
This avoids key confusion issues (see {{SEEMS-LEGIT}}). The encoding of the
public key is described in {{context}}.

## The p Parameter {#parameter-p}

The REQUIRED "p" (proof) parameter is a byte sequence that specifies the proof
that the user agent provides to attest to possessing the credential that matches
its key ID.

## The s Parameter {#parameter-s}

The REQUIRED "s" (signature) parameter is an integer that specifies the
signature scheme used to compute the proof transmitted in the "p" directive.
Its value is an integer between 0 and 65535 inclusive from the IANA "TLS
SignatureScheme" registry maintained at
<[](https://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-parameters/tls-parameters.xhtml#tls-signaturescheme)>.

## The v Parameter {#parameter-v}

The REQUIRED "v" (verification) parameter is a byte sequence that specifies the
verification that the user agent provides to attest to possessing the key
exporter output (see {{output}} for details). This avoids issues with signature
schemes where certain keys can generate signatures that are valid for multiple
inputs (see {{SEEMS-LEGIT}}).

# Example {#example}

For example, the key ID "basement" authenticating using Ed25519
{{?ED25519=RFC8410}} could produce the following header field:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Authorization: Signature \
  k=YmFzZW1lbnQ, \
  a=VGhpcyBpcyBhIHB1YmxpYyBrZXkgaW4gdXNlIGhlcmU, \
  s=2055, \
  v=dmVyaWZpY2F0aW9uXzE2Qg, \
  p=SW5zZXJ0IHNpZ25hdHVyZSBvZiBub25jZSBoZXJlIHdo \
    aWNoIHRha2VzIDUxMiBiaXRzIGZvciBFZDI1NTE5IQ
~~~
{: #fig-hdr-example title="Example Header Field"}

# Non-Probeable Server Handling

Servers that wish to introduce resources whose existence cannot be probed need
to ensure that they do not reveal any information about those resources to
unauthenticated clients. In particular, such servers MUST respond to
authentication failures with the exact same response that they would have used
for non-existent resources. For example, this can mean using HTTP status code
404 (Not Found) instead of 401 (Unauthorized). Such authentication failures
can be caused for example by:

* absence of the Authorization (or Proxy-Authorization) field

* failure to parse that field

* use of the Signature authentication scheme with an unknown key ID

* mismatch between key ID and provided public key

* failure to validate the verification parameter

* failure to validate the signature.

In order to validate the signature, the server needs to first parse the field
containing the signature, then look up the key ID in its database of public
keys, and finally perform the cryptographic validation. These steps can take
time, and an attacker could detect use of this mechanism if that time is
observable by comparing the timing of a request for a known non-existent
resource to the timing of a request for a potentially authenticated resource.
Servers can mitigate this observability by slightly delaying responses to some
non-existent resources such that the timing of the authentication verification
is not observable. This delay needs to be carefully considered to avoid having
the delay itself leak the fact that this origin uses this mechanism at all.

Non-probeable resources also need to be non-discoverable for unauthenticated
users. For example, if a server operator wishes to hide an authenticated
resource by pretending it does not exist to unauthenticated users, then the
server operator needs to ensure there are no unauthenticated pages with links
to that resource, and no other out-of-band ways for unauthenticated users to
discover this resource.

# Intermediary Considerations {#intermediary}

Since the Signature HTTP authentication scheme leverages TLS keying material
exporters, its output cannot be transparently forwarded by HTTP intermediaries.
HTTP intermediaries that support this specification have two options:

* The intermediary can validate the authentication received from the client,
  then inform the upstream HTTP server of the presence of valid authentication.

* The intermediary can export the Signature Input and Verification (see
  {{output}}}), and forward it to the upstream HTTP server, then the upstream
  server performs the validation.

The mechanism for the intermediary to communicate this information to the
upstream HTTP server is out of scope for this document.

Note that both of these mechanisms require the upstream HTTP server to trust
the intermediary. This is usually the case because the intermediary already
needs access to the TLS certificate private key in order to respond to requests.

# Security Considerations {#security}

The Signature HTTP authentication scheme allows a user agent to authenticate to
an origin server while guaranteeing freshness and without the need for the
server to transmit a nonce to the user agent. This allows the server to accept
authenticated clients without revealing that it supports or expects
authentication for some resources. It also allows authentication without the
user agent leaking the presence of authentication to observers due to
clear-text TLS Client Hello extensions.

The authentication proofs described in this document are not bound to
individual HTTP requests; if the key is used for authentication proofs on
multiple requests on the same connection, they will all be identical. This
allows for better compression when sending over the wire, but implies that
client implementations that multiplex different security contexts over a single
HTTP connection need to ensure that those contexts cannot read each other's
header fields. Otherwise, one context would be able to replay the Authorization
header field of another. This constraint is met by modern Web browsers. If an
attacker were to compromise the browser such that it could access another
context's memory, the attacker might also be able to access the corresponding
key, so binding authentication to requests would not provide much benefit in
practice.

Key material used for the Signature HTTP authentication scheme MUST NOT be
reused in other protocols. Doing so can undermine the security guarantees of
the authentication.

Origins offering this scheme can link requests that use the same key.
However, requests are not linkable across origins if the keys used are specific
to the individual origins using this scheme.
