# Introduction

This specification defines a mechanism for using designated {{HTTP}} responses
as an external dictionary for future HTTP responses for compression schemes
that support using external dictionaries (e.g., Brotli {{RFC7932}} and
Zstandard {{RFC8878}}).

This document describes the HTTP headers used for negotiating dictionary usage
and registers media types for content encoding Brotli and Zstandard using a
negotiated dictionary.

## Notational Conventions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This document uses the following terminology from Section 3 of
{{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}} to specify syntax and parsing: Dictionary, String,
Inner List, Token, and Byte Sequence.

This document uses the line folding strategies described in {{FOLDING}}.

This document also uses terminology from {{HTTP}} and {{HTTP-CACHING}}.

# Dictionary Negotiation

## Use-As-Dictionary

When responding to a HTTP Request, a server can advertise that the response can
be used as a dictionary for future requests for URLs that match the rules
specified in the Use-As-Dictionary response header.

The Use-As-Dictionary response header is a Structured Field
{{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}} Dictionary with values for "match", "match-dest", "id",
and "type".

### match

The "match" value of the Use-As-Dictionary header is a String value that
provides the URL Pattern {{URLPattern}} to use for request matching.

The URL Pattern used for matching does not support using Regular expressions.

The following algorithm will return TRUE for a valid match pattern and FALSE
for an invalid pattern that MUST NOT be used:

1. Let MATCH be the value of "match" for the given dictionary.
1. Let URL be the URL of the dictionary request.
1. Let PATTERN be a URL Pattern {{URLPattern}} constructed by setting
input=MATCH, and baseURL=URL.
1. If PATTERN has regexp groups then return FALSE.
1. Return True.

The "match" value is required and MUST be included in the
Use-As-Dictionary Dictionary for the dictionary to be considered valid.

### match-dest

The "match-dest" value of the Use-As-Dictionary header is an Inner List of
String values that provides a list of {{FETCH}} request destinations for the
dictionary to match.

An empty list for "match-dest" MUST match all destinations.

For clients that do not support request destinations, the client MUST treat it
as an empty list and match all destinations.

The "match-dest" value is optional and defaults to an empty list.

### id

The "id" value of the Use-As-Dictionary header is a String value that specifies
a server identifier for the dictionary. If an "id" value is present and has a
string length longer than zero then it MUST be sent to the server in a
"Dictionary-ID" request header when the dictionary is advertised as being
available.

The server identifier MUST be treated as an opaque string by the client.

The server identifier MUST NOT be relied upon by the server to guarantee the
contents of the dictionary. The dictionary hash MUST be validated before use.

The "id" value string length (after any decoding) supports up to 1024
characters.

The "id" value is optional and defaults to the empty string.

### type

The "type" value of the Use-As-Dictionary header is a Token value that
describes the file format of the supplied dictionary.

"raw" is the only defined dictionary format which represents an unformatted
blob of bytes suitable for any compression scheme to use.

If a client receives a dictionary with a type that it does not understand, it
MUST NOT use the dictionary.

The "type" value is optional and defaults to raw.

### Examples

#### Path Prefix

A response that contained a response header:

~~~ http-message
NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

Use-As-Dictionary: \
  match="/product/*", match-dest=("document")
~~~

Would specify matching any document request for a URL with a path prefix of
/product/ on the same Origin ({{Section 4.3.1 of HTTP}}) as the original
request.

#### Versioned Directories

A response that contained a response header:

~~~ http-message
Use-As-Dictionary: match="/app/*/main.js"
~~~

Would match main.js in any directory under /app/ and expiring as a dictionary
in one year.

## Available-Dictionary

When a HTTP client makes a request for a resource for which it has an
appropriate dictionary, it can add a "Available-Dictionary" request header
to the request to indicate to the server that it has a dictionary available to
use for compression.

The "Available-Dictionary" request header is a Structured Field
{{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}} Byte Sequence containing the {{SHA-256}} hash of the
contents of a single available dictionary.

The client MUST only send a single "Available-Dictionary" request header
with a single hash value for the best available match that it has available.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Available-Dictionary: :pZGm1Av0IEBKARczz7exkNYsZb8LzaMrV7J32a2fFG4=:
~~~

### Dictionary freshness requirement

To be considered as a match, the dictionary resource MUST be either fresh
[HTTP-CACHING] or allowed to be served stale (see eg [RFC5861]).

### Dictionary URL matching

When a dictionary is stored as a result of a "Use-As-Dictionary" directive, it
includes "match" and "match-dest" strings that are used to match an outgoing
request from a client to the available dictionaries.

Dictionaries MUST have been served from the same Origin
({{Section 4.3.1 of HTTP}}) as the outgoing request to match.

To see if an outbound request matches a given dictionary, the following
algorithm will return TRUE for a successful match and FALSE for no-match:

1. If the current client supports request destinations:
    * Let DEST be the value of "match-dest" for the given dictionary.
    * Let REQUEST_DEST be the value of the destination for the current
    request.
    * If DEST is not an empty list and if REQUEST_DEST is not in the DEST list
    of destinations, return FALSE
1. Let BASEURL be the URL of the dictionary request.
1. Let URL represent the URL of the outbound request being checked.
1. If the Origin of BASEURL and the Origin of URL are not the same, return
FALSE.
1. Let MATCH be the value of "match" for the given dictionary.
1. Let PATTERN be a URL Pattern {{URLPattern}} constructed by setting
input=MATCH, and baseURL=BASEURL.
1. Return the result of running the "test" method of PATTERN with input=URL.

### Multiple matching dictionaries

When there are multiple dictionaries that match a given request URL, the client
MUST pick a single dictionary using the following rules:

1. For clients that support request destinations, a dictionary that specifies
and matches a "match-dest" takes precedence over a match that does not use a
destination.
1. Given equivalent destination precedence, the dictionary with the longest
"match" takes precedence.
1. Given equivalent destination and match length precedence, the most recently
fetched dictionary takes precedence.

## Dictionary-ID

When a HTTP client makes a request for a resource for which it has an
appropriate dictionary and the dictionary was stored with a server-provided
"id" in the Use-As-Dictionary response then the client MUST echo the stored
"id" in a "Dictionary-ID" request header.

The "Dictionary-ID" request header is a Structured Field {{STRUCTURED-FIELDS}}
String of up to 1024 characters (after any decoding) and MUST be identical to
the server-provided "id".

For example:

~~~ http-message
Available-Dictionary: :pZGm1Av0IEBKARczz7exkNYsZb8LzaMrV7J32a2fFG4=:
Dictionary-ID: "/v1/main.js 33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
~~~

# The 'compression-dictionary' Link Relation Type

This specification defines the 'compression-dictionary' link relation type
{{WEB-LINKING}} that provides a mechanism for a HTTP response to provide a URL
for a compression dictionary that is related to, but not directly used by the
current HTTP response.

The 'compression-dictionary' link relation type indicates that fetching and
caching the specified resource is likely to be beneficial for future requests.
The response to some of those future requests are likely to be able to use
the indicated resource as a compression dictionary.

Clients can fetch the provided resource at a time that they determine would
be appropriate.

The response to the fetch for the compression dictionary needs to include a
"Use-As-Dictionary" and caching response headers for it to be usable as a
compression dictionary. The link relation only provides the mechanism for
triggering the fetch of the dictionary.

The following example shows a link to a resource at
https://example.org/dict.dat that is expected to produce a compression
dictionary:

~~~ http-message
Link: <https://example.org/dict.dat>; rel="compression-dictionary"
~~~

# Dictionary-Compressed Brotli

The "dcb" content encoding identifies a resource that is a
"Dictionary-Compressed Brotli" stream.

A "Dictionary-Compressed Brotli" stream has a fixed header that is followed by
a Shared Brotli {{SHARED-BROTLI}} stream. The header consists of a fixed 4 byte
sequence and a 32 byte hash of the external dictionary that was used.  The
Shared Brotli stream is created using the referenced external dictionary and a
compression window that is at most 16 MB in size.

The dictionary used for the "dcb" content encoding is a "raw" dictionary type
as defined in {{type}} and is treated as a prefix dictionary as defined in
section 9.2 of the Shared Brotli Compressed Data Format draft.
{{SHARED-BROTLI}}

The 36-byte fixed header is as follows:

Magic_Number:
: 4 fixed bytes: 0xff, 0x44, 0x43, 0x42.

SHA_256_Hash:
: 32 Bytes. SHA-256 hash digest of the dictionary {{SHA-256}}.

Clients that announce support for dcb content encoding MUST be able to
decompress resources that were compressed with a window size of up to 16 MB.

With Brotli compression, the full dictionary is available during compression
and decompression independent of the compression window, allowing for
delta-compression of resources larger than the compression window.

# Dictionary-Compressed Zstandard

The "dcz" content encoding identifies a resource that is a
"Dictionary-Compressed Zstandard" stream.

A "Dictionary-Compressed Zstandard" stream is a binary stream that starts with
a 40-byte fixed header and is followed by a Zstandard {{RFC8878}} stream of the
response that has been compressed with an external dictionary.

The dictionary used for the "dcz" content encoding is a "raw" dictionary type
as defined in {{type}} and is treated as a raw dictionary as per section 5 of
RFC 8878.

The 40-byte header consists of a fixed 8-byte sequence followed by the
32-byte SHA-256 hash of the external dictionary that was used to compress the
resource:

Magic_Number:
: 8 fixed bytes: 0x5e, 0x2a, 0x4d, 0x18, 0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00.

SHA_256_Hash:
: 32 Bytes. SHA-256 hash digest of the dictionary {{SHA-256}}.

The 40-byte header is a Zstandard skippable frame (little-endian 0x184D2A5E)
with a 32-byte length (little-endian 0x00000020) that is compatible with existing
Zstandard decoders.

Clients that announce support for dcz content encoding MUST be able to
decompress resources that were compressed with a window size of at least 8 MB
or 1.25 times the size of the dictionary, which ever is greater, up to a
maximum of 128 MB.

The window size used will be encoded in the content (currently, this can be expressed
in powers of two only) and it MUST be lower than this limit. An implementation MAY
treat a window size that exceeds the limit as a decoding error.

With Zstandard compression, the full dictionary is available during compression
and decompression until the size of the input exceeds the compression window.
Beyond that point the dictionary becomes unavailable. Using a compression
window that is 1.25 times the size of the dictionary allows for full delta
compression of resources that have grown by 25% between releases while still
giving the client control over the memory it will need to allocate for a given
response.

# Negotiating the content encoding

When a compression dictionary is available for use for a given request, the
encoding to be used is negotiated through the regular mechanism for
negotiating content encoding in HTTP through the "Accept-Encoding" request
header and "Content-Encoding" response header.

The dictionary to use is negotiated separately and advertised in the
"Available-Dictionary" request header.

## Accept-Encoding

When a dictionary is available for use on a given request, and the client
chooses to make dictionary-based content-encoding available, the client adds
the dictionary-aware content encodings that it supports to the
"Accept-Encoding" request header. e.g.:

~~~ http-message
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd, dcb, dcz
~~~

When a client does not have a stored dictionary that matches the request, or
chooses not to use one for the request, the client MUST NOT send its
dictionary-aware content-encodings in the "Accept-Encoding" request header.

## Content-Encoding

If a server supports one of the dictionary encodings advertised by the client
and chooses to compress the content of the response using the dictionary that
the client has advertised then it sets the "Content-Encoding" response header
to the appropriate value for the algorithm selected. e.g.:

~~~ http-message
Content-Encoding: dcb
~~~

If the response is cacheable, it MUST include a "Vary" header to prevent caches
serving dictionary-compressed resources to clients that don't support them or
serving the response compressed with the wrong dictionary:

~~~ http-message
Vary: accept-encoding, available-dictionary
~~~

# IANA Considerations

## Link Relation Registration

IANA is asked to update the "Link Relation Type Registry" registry
({{WEB-LINKING}}):

- Relation Name: compression-dictionary
- Description: Refers to a compression dictionary used for content encoding.
- Reference: This document, {{the-compression-dictionary-link-relation-type}}

# Compatibility Considerations

To minimize the risk of middle-boxes incorrectly processing
dictionary-compressed responses, compression dictionary transport MUST only
be used in secure contexts (HTTPS).

# Security Considerations

The security considerations for Brotli {{RFC7932}}, Shared Brotli
{{SHARED-BROTLI}} and Zstandard {{RFC8878}} apply to the
dictionary-based versions of the respective algorithms.

## Changing content

The dictionary must be treated with the same security precautions as
the content, because a change to the dictionary can result in a
change to the decompressed content.

The dictionary is validated using a SHA-256 hash of the content to make sure
that the client and server are both using the same dictionary. The strength
of the SHA-256 hash algorithm isn't explicitly needed to counter attacks
since the dictionary is being served from the same origin as the content. That
said, if a weakness is discovered in SHA-256 and it is determined that the
dictionary negotiation should use a different hash algorithm, the
"Use-As-Dictionary" response header can be extended to specify a different
algorithm and the server would just ignore any "Available-Dictionary" requests
that do not use the updated hash.

## Reading content

The compression attacks in {{Section 2.6 of RFC7457}} show that it's a bad idea
to compress data from mixed (e.g. public and private) sources -- the data
sources include not only the compressed data but also the dictionaries. For
example, if you compress secret cookies using a public-data-only dictionary,
you still leak information about the cookies.

Not only can the dictionary reveal information about the compressed
data, but vice versa, data compressed with the dictionary can reveal
the contents of the dictionary when an adversary can control parts of
data to compress and see the compressed size. On the other hand, if
the adversary can control the dictionary, the adversary can learn
information about the compressed data.

## Security Mitigations

If any of the mitigations do not pass, the client MUST drop the response and
return an error.

### Cross-origin protection

To make sure that a dictionary can only impact content from the same origin
where the dictionary was served, the URL Pattern used for matching a dictionary
to requests ({{match}}) is guaranteed to be for the same origin that the
dictionary is served from.

### Response readability

For clients, like web browsers, that provide additional protection against the
readability of the payload of a response and against user tracking, additional
protections MUST be taken to make sure that the use of dictionary-based
compression does not reveal information that would not otherwise be available.

In these cases, dictionary compression MUST only be used when both the
dictionary and the compressed response are fully readable by the client.

In browser terms, that means that both are either same-origin to the context
they are being fetched from or that the response is cross-origin and passes
the CORS check as defined in {{FETCH}}.

### Server Responsibility

As with any usage of compressed content in a secure context, a potential
timing attack exists if the attacker can control any part of the dictionary,
or if it can read the dictionary and control any part of the content being
compressed, while performing multiple requests that vary the dictionary or
injected content. Under such an attack, the changing size or processing time
of the response reveals information about the content, which might be
sufficient to read the supposedly secure response.

In general, a server can mitigate such attacks by preventing variations per
request, as in preventing active use of multiple dictionaries for the same
content, disabling compression when any portion of the content comes from
uncontrolled sources, and securing access and control over the dictionary
content in the same way as the response content. In addition, the following
requirements on a server are intended to disable dictionary-aware compression
when the client provides CORS request header fields that indicate a
cross-origin request context.

The following algorithm will return FALSE for cross-origin requests where
precautions such as not using dictionary-based compression should be
considered:

1. If there is no "Sec-Fetch-Site" request header then return TRUE.
1. if the value of the "Sec-Fetch-Site" request header is "same-origin" then
return TRUE.
1. If there is no "Sec-Fetch-Mode" request header then return TRUE.
1. If the value of the "Sec-Fetch-Mode" request header is "navigate" or
"same-origin" then return TRUE.
1. If the value of the "Sec-Fetch-Mode" request header is "cors":
    * If the response does not include an "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header then return FALSE.
    * If the request does not include an "Origin" request header then return FALSE.
    * If the value of the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header is "*" then return TRUE.
    * If the value of the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" response header matches the value of the "Origin" request header then return TRUE.
1. return FALSE.

# Privacy Considerations

Since dictionaries are advertised in future requests using the hash of the
content of the dictionary, it is possible to abuse the dictionary to turn it
into a tracking cookie.

To mitigate any additional tracking concerns, clients MUST treat dictionaries
in the same way that they treat cookies [RFC6265]. This includes partitioning
the storage as cookies are partitioned as well as clearing the dictionaries
whenever cookies are cleared.
