1.  Introduction

   HTTP [HTTP] clients need to know that the content they receive on a
   connection comes from the origin from which they intended to retrieve
   it.  The traditional form of server authentication in HTTP has been
   in the form of a single X.509 certificate provided during the TLS
   [TLS13] handshake.

   TLS supports one server and one client certificate on a connection.
   These certificates may contain multiple identities, but only one
   certificate may be provided.

   Many HTTP servers host content from several origins.  HTTP/2 [H2] and
   HTTP/3 [H3] permit clients to reuse an existing HTTP connection to a
   server provided that the secondary origin is also in the certificate
   provided during the TLS handshake.  In many cases, servers choose to
   maintain separate certificates for different origins but still desire
   the benefits of a shared HTTP connection.  This document defines a
   capability for servers to use and to authenticate with those seperate
   certificates over a shared connection.

   The ability to maintain seperate certificates for different origins
   can also allow proxies that cache content from secondary origins to
   communicate to clients that they can service some of those origins
   directly, allowing the proxy to behave as a TLS-terminating reverse
   proxy for those origins instead of establishing a TLS encrypted
   tunnel through the proxy.

1.1.  Server Certificate Authentication

   Section 9.1.1 of [H2] and Section 3.3 of [H3] describe how
   connections may be used to make requests from multiple origins as
   long as the server is authoritative for both.  A server is considered
   authoritative for an origin if DNS resolves the origin to the IP
   address of the server and (for TLS) if the certificate presented by
   the server contains the origin in the Subject Alternative Names
   field.

   [ALTSVC] enables a step of abstraction from the DNS resolution.  If
   both hosts have provided an Alternative Service at hostnames which
   resolve to the IP address of the server, they are considered
   authoritative just as if DNS resolved the origin itself to that
   address.  However, the server's one TLS certificate is still required
   to contain the name of each origin in question.

   [ORIGIN] relaxes the requirement to perform the DNS lookup if already
   connected to a server with an appropriate certificate which claims
   support for a particular origin.

   Servers which host many origins often would prefer to have separate
   certificates for some sets of origins.  This may be for ease of
   certificate management (the ability to separately revoke or renew
   them), due to different sources of certificates (a CDN acting on
   behalf of multiple origins), or other factors which might drive this
   administrative decision.  Clients connecting to such origins cannot
   currently reuse connections, even if both client and server would
   prefer to do so.

   Because the TLS SNI extension is exchanged in the clear, clients
   might also prefer to retrieve certificates inside the encrypted
   context.  When this information is sensitive, it might be
   advantageous to request a general-purpose certificate or anonymous
   ciphersuite at the TLS layer, while acquiring the "real" certificate
   in HTTP after the connection is established.

1.2.  TLS Exported Authenticators

   TLS Exported Authenticators [EXPORTED-AUTH] are structured messages
   that can be exported by either party of a TLS connection and
   validated by the other party.  Given an established TLS connection,
   an authenticator message can be constructed proving possession of a
   certificate and a corresponding private key.  The mechanisms that
   this document defines are primarily focused on the server's ability
   to generate TLS Exported Authenticators.

   Each Authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished
   MAC Key derived from the TLS session.  The Handshake Context is
   identical for both parties of the TLS connection, while the Finished
   MAC Key is dependent on whether the Authenticator is created by the
   client or the server.

   Successfully verified Authenticators result in certificate chains,
   with verified possession of the corresponding private key, which can
   be supplied into a collection of available certificates.  Likewise,
   descriptions of desired certificates can also be supplied into these
   collections.

1.3.  HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   This document defines HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 SERVER_CERTIFICATE frames
   (Section 5) to carry the relevant certificate messages, enabling
   certificate-based authentication of servers independent of TLS
   version.  This mechanism can be implemented at the HTTP layer without
   breaking the existing interface between HTTP and applications above
   it.

   TLS Exported Authenticators [EXPORTED-AUTH] allow the opportunity for
   an HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers to send certificate frames which can be
   used to prove the servers authenticity for multiple origins.

   This document additionally defines SETTINGS parameters for HTTP/2 and
   HTTP/3 (Section 4) that allow the client and server to indicate
   support for HTTP-Layer certificate authentication.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Discovering Additional Certificates at the HTTP Layer

   A certificate chain with proof of possession of the private key
   corresponding to the end-entity certificate is sent as a sequence of
   SERVER_CERTIFICATE frames (see Section 5.1, Section 5.2) to the
   client.  Once the holder of a certificate has sent the chain and
   proof, this certificate chain is cached by the recipient and
   available for future use.

3.1.  Indicating Support for HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   The SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH parameters for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3
   are defined in Section 4 so that clients and servers can indicate
   support for secondary certificate authentication of servers.

   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 endpoints who wish to indicate support for HTTP-
   Layer certificate authentication MUST send a
   SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH parameter set to "1" in their SETTINGS
   frame.  Endpoints MUST NOT use any of the authentication
   functionality described in this document unless the parameter has
   been negotiated by both sides.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send a SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH parameter
   with a value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1.

   SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH indicates that servers are able to
   offer additional certificates to demonstrate control over other
   origin hostnames, and that clients are able to make requests for
   hostnames received in a TLS Exported Authenticator that the server
   sends.

3.2.  Making Certificates Available

   When both peers have advertised support for HTTP-layer certificates
   in a given direction as in Section 3.1, the indicated endpoint can
   supply additional certificates into the connection at any time.  That
   is, if both endpoints have sent SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH and
   validated the value received from the peer, the server may send
   certificates spontaneously, at any time, as described by the
   Spontaneous Server Authentication message sequence in Section 3 of
   [EXPORTED-AUTH].

   This does mean that if a server knows it supports secondary
   certificate authentication, and it receives
   SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH from the client, that it can enqueue
   certificates immediately following the received SETTINGS frame.

   Certificates supplied by servers can be considered by clients without
   further action by the server.  A server SHOULD NOT send certificates
   which do not cover origins which it is prepared to service on the
   current connection, and SHOULD NOT send them if the client has not
   indicated support with SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH.

   A client MUST NOT send certificates to the server.  The server SHOULD
   close the connection upon receipt of a SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame from
   a client.

   Client                                               Server
      <-- (stream 0 / control stream) SERVER_CERTIFICATE --
      ...
      -- (stream N) GET /from-new-origin ----------------->
      <------------------------------ (stream N) 200 OK ---

             Figure 1: Simple unprompted server authentication

   A server MAY send a SERVER_CERTIFICATE immediately after sending its
   SETTINGS.  However, it MAY also send certificates at any time later.
   For example, a proxy might discover that a client is interested in an
   origin that it can reverse proxy at the time that a client sends a
   CONNECT request.  It can then send certificates for those origins to
   allow for TLS-terminated reverse proxying to those origins for the
   remainder of the connection lifetime.  Figure 2 illustrates this
   behavior.

   Client                                                 Server
      -- (stream N) CONNECT /to-new-origin ----------------->
      <---- (stream 0 / control stream) SERVER_CERTIFICATE --
      <---- (stream 0 / control stream) 200 OK --------------
      ...
      -- (stream M) GET /to-new-origin --------------------->
      <------------ (stream M, direct from server) 200 OK ---

               Figure 2: Reverse proxy server authentication

4.  SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH

   SETTINGS parameters for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 seperately are defined
   below.

4.1.  The SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH HTTP/2 SETTINGS Parameter

   This document adds a new HTTP/2 SETTINGS(0xTBD) parameter to those
   defined by Section 6.5.2 of [H2].

   The new parameter name is SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH.  The value
   of the parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

   The usage of this parameter is described in Section 3.1.

4.2.  The SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH HTTP/3 SETTINGS Parameter

   This document adds a new HTTP/3 SETTINGS(0xTBD) parameter to those
   defined by Section 7.2.4.1 of [H3].

   The new parameter name is SETTINGS_HTTP_SERVER_CERT_AUTH.  The value
   of the parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

   The usage of this parameter is described in Section 3.1.

5.  SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame contains an exported authenticator
   message from the TLS layer that provides a chain of certificates and
   associated extensions, proving possession of the private key
   corresponding to the end-entity certificate.

   A server sends a SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame on stream 0 for HTTP/2 and
   on the control stream for HTTP/3.  The client is permitted to make
   subsequent requests for resources upon receipt of a
   SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame without further action from the server.

   Upon receiving a complete series of SERVER_CERTIFICATE frames, the
   receiver may validate the Exported Authenticator value by using the
   exported authenticator API.  This returns either an error indicating
   that the message was invalid or the certificate chain and extensions
   used to create the message.

5.1.  HTTP/2 SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame

   A SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame in HTTP/2 (type=0xTBD) carrries a TLS
   Exported authenticator that clients can use to authenticate secondary
   origins from a sending server.

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame MUST be sent on stream 0.  A
   SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame received on any other stream MUST not be
   used for server authentication.

   SERVER_CERTIFICATE Frame {
     Length (24),
     Type (8) = 0xTBD,

     Unused Flags (8),

     Reserved (1),
     Stream Identifier (31) = 0,

     Authenticator (..),
   }

                 Figure 3: HTTP/2 SERVER_CERTIFICATE Frame

   The Length, Type, Unused Flag(s), Reserved, and Stream Identifier
   fields are described in Section 4 of [H2].

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame does not define any flags.

   The authenticator field is a portion of the opaque data returned from
   the TLS connection exported authenticator authenticate API.  See
   Section 5.3 for more details on the input to this API.

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame applies to the connection, not a
   specific stream.  An endpoint MUST treat a SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame
   with a stream identifier other than 0x00 as a connection error.

5.2.  HTTP/3 SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame

   A SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame in HTTP/3 (type=0xTBD) carrries a TLS
   Exported authenticator that clients can use to authenticate secondary
   origins from a sending server.

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame MUST be sent on the control stream.  A
   SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame received on any other stream MUST not be
   used for server authentication.

   SERVER_CERTIFICATE Frame {
     Type (i) = 0xTBD,
     Length (i),
     Authenticator (...),
   }

                 Figure 4: HTTP/3 SERVER_CERTIFICATE Frame

   The Type and Length fields are described in Section 7.1 of [H3].

   The authenticator field is a portion of the opaque data returned from
   the TLS connection exported authenticator authenticate API.  See
   Section 5.3 for more details on the input to this API.

   The SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame applies to the connection, not a
   specific stream.  An endpoint MUST treat a SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame
   received on any stream other than the control stream as a connection
   error.

5.3.  Exported Authenticator Characteristics

   The Exported Authenticator API defined in [EXPORTED-AUTH] takes as
   input a request, a set of certificates, and supporting information
   about the certificate (OCSP, SCT, etc.).  The result is an opaque
   token which is used when generating the SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame.

   Upon receipt of a SERVER_CERTIFICATE frame, an endpoint which has
   negotiated support for secondary certfiicates MUST perform the
   following steps to validate the token it contains:

   *  Using the get context API, retrieve the
      certificate_request_context used to generate the authenticator, if
      any.  Because the certificate_request_context for spontaneous
      server certificates is chosen by the server, the usage of the
      certificate_request_context is implementation-dependent.  For
      details, see Section 5 of [EXPORTED-AUTH].

   *  Use the validate API to confirm the validity of the authenticator
      with regard to the generated request, if any.

   If the authenticator cannot be validated, this SHOULD be treated as a
   connection error.

   Once the authenticator is accepted, the endpoint can perform any
   other checks for the acceptability of the certificate itself.

6.  Indicating Failures During HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

   Because this document permits certificates to be exchanged at the
   HTTP framing layer instead of the TLS layer, several certificate-
   related errors which are defined at the TLS layer might now occur at
   the HTTP framing layer.

   There are two classes of errors which might be encountered, and they
   are handled differently.

6.1.  Misbehavior

   This category of errors could indicate a peer failing to follow
   requirements in this document or might indicate that the connection
   is not fully secure.  These errors are fatal to stream or connection,
   as appropriate.

   SERVER_CERTIFICATE_UNREADABLE (0xERROR-TBD):  An exported
      authenticator could not be validated.

6.2.  Invalid Certificates

   Unacceptable certificates (expired, revoked, or insufficient to
   satisfy the request) are not treated as stream or connection errors.
   This is typically not an indication of a protocol failure.  Clients
   SHOULD establish a new connection in an attempt to reach an
   authoritative server if they deem a certificate from the server
   unacceptable.

7.  Security Considerations

   This mechanism defines an alternate way to obtain server and client
   certificates other than in the initial TLS handshake.  While the
   signature of exported authenticator values is expected to be equally
   secure, it is important to recognize that a vulnerability in this
   code path is at least equal to a vulnerability in the TLS handshake.

7.1.  Impersonation

   This mechanism could increase the impact of a key compromise.  Rather
   than needing to subvert DNS or IP routing in order to use a
   compromised certificate, a malicious server now only needs a client
   to connect to _some_ HTTPS site under its control in order to present
   the compromised certificate.  Clients SHOULD consult DNS for
   hostnames presented in secondary certificates if they would have done
   so for the same hostname if it were present in the primary
   certificate.

   As recommended in [ORIGIN], clients opting not to consult DNS ought
   to employ some alternative means to increase confidence that the
   certificate is legitimate, such as an ORIGIN frame.

   As noted in the Security Considerations of [EXPORTED-AUTH], it is
   difficult to formally prove that an endpoint is jointly authoritative
   over multiple certificates, rather than individually authoritative on
   each certificate.  As a result, clients MUST NOT assume that because
   one origin was previously colocated with another, those origins will
   be reachable via the same endpoints in the future.  Clients MUST NOT
   consider previous secondary certificates to be validated after TLS
   session resumption.  Servers MAY re-present certificates if a TLS
   Session is resumed.

7.2.  Fingerprinting

   This document defines a mechanism which could be used to probe
   servers for origins they support, but it opens no new attack that was
   not already possible by making repeat TLS connections with different
   SNI values.

7.3.  Persistence of Service

   CNAME records in the DNS are frequently used to delegate authority
   for an origin to a third-party provider.  This delegation can be
   changed without notice, even to the third-party provider, simply by
   modifying the CNAME record in question.

   After the owner of the domain has redirected traffic elsewhere by
   changing the CNAME, new connections will not arrive for that origin,
   but connections which are properly directed to this provider for
   other origins would continue to claim control of this origin (via
   Secondary Certificates).  This is proper behavior based on the third-
   party provider's configuration, but would likely not be what is
   intended by the owner of the origin.

   This is not an issue which can be mitigated by the protocol, but
   something about which third-party providers SHOULD educate their
   customers before using the features described in this document.

7.4.  Confusion About State

   Implementations need to be aware of the potential for confusion about
   the state of a connection.  The presence or absence of a validated
   certificate can change during the processing of a request,
   potentially multiple times, as SERVER_CERTIFICATE frames are
   received.  A client that uses certificate authentication needs to be
   prepared to reevaluate the authorization state of a request as the
   set of certificates changes.

   Behavior for TLS-Terminated reverse proxies is also worth
   considering.  If a server which situationally reverse-proxies wishes
   for the client to view a request made prior to receipt of
   certificates as TLS-Terminated, or wishes for the client to start a
   new tunnel alternatively, this document does not currently define
   formal mechanisms to facilitate that intention.
