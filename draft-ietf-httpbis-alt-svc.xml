<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
   HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> conflates the identification of
   resources with their location. In other words, "http://" (and "https://") URLs are
   used to both name and find things to interact with.
</t>
<t>
   In some cases, it is desirable to separate identification and location in HTTP; keeping the same
   identifier for a resource, but interacting with it at a different location on the network.
</t>
<t>For example:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>
       An origin server might wish to redirect a client to a different server when it
       needs to go down for maintenance, or it has found a server in a
       location that is more local to the client.
    </t>
    <t>
       An origin server might wish to offer access to its resources using a new
       protocol (such as HTTP/2, see <xref target="HTTP2"/>) or one using improved
       security (such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), see <xref target="RFC5246"/>).
    </t>
    <t>
       An origin server might wish to segment its clients into groups of
       capabilities, such as those supporting Server Name Indication (SNI,
       see <xref target="RFC6066" x:sec="3" x:fmt="of"/>) and those not
       supporting it, for operational purposes.
    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   This specification defines a new concept in HTTP, "Alternative Services",
   that allows an origin server to nominate additional means of interacting with it on
   the network. It defines a general framework for this in <xref
   target="alternative"/>, along with specific mechanisms for advertising their
   existence using HTTP header fields (<xref target="alt-svc"/>) or an HTTP/2
   frame type (<xref target="frame"/>).
</t>
<t>
   It also introduces a new status code in <xref target="status"/>, so that origin servers (or
   their nominated alternatives) can indicate that they are not authoritative for
   a given origin, in cases where the wrong location is used.
</t>

<section title="Notational Conventions" anchor="notational-conventions">
<t>
  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
  "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
  interpreted as described in <xref target="RFC2119"/>.
</t>
<t>
  This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in <xref target="RFC5234"/>
  along with the "OWS", "delta-seconds", "parameter", "port", "quoted-string", "token",
  and "uri-host" rules from <xref target="RFC7230"/>, and uses the "#rule"
  extension defined in <xref target="RFC7230" x:rel="#abnf.extension" x:fmt="sec"/> of that document.
</t>
</section>

    </section>

<section title="Alternative Services Concepts" anchor="alternative">
<t>
   This specification defines a new concept in HTTP, the "<x:dfn>alternative service</x:dfn>".
   When an origin (see <xref target="RFC6454"/>) has resources that are accessible through a
   different protocol / host / port combination, it is said to have an alternative
   service available.
</t>
<t>
   An alternative service can be used to interact with the resources on an origin
   server at a separate location on the network, possibly using a different
   protocol configuration. Alternative services are considered authoritative for
   an origin's resources, in the sense of <xref target="RFC7230" x:rel="#establishing.authority" x:fmt=","/>.
</t>
<figure>
  <preamble>For example, an origin:</preamble>
  <artwork type="example">
("http", "www.example.com", "80")
</artwork>
</figure>
<figure>
<preamble>might declare that its resources are also accessible at the alternative service:</preamble>
<artwork type="example">
("h2", "new.example.com", "81")
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
   By their nature, alternative services are explicitly at the granularity of an
   origin; i.e., they cannot be selectively applied to resources within an origin.
</t>
<t>
   Alternative services do not replace or change the origin for any given resource;
   in general, they are not visible to the software "above" the access mechanism.
   The alternative service is essentially alternative routing information that can
   also be used to reach the origin in the same way that DNS CNAME or SRV records
   define routing information at the name resolution level. Each origin maps to a
   set of these routes &mdash; the default route is derived from origin itself and the
   other routes are introduced based on alternative-protocol information.
</t>
<t>
   Furthermore, it is important to note that the first member of an alternative
   service tuple is different from the "scheme" component of an origin; it is more
   specific, identifying not only the major version of the protocol being used,
   but potentially communication options for that protocol.
</t>
<t>
   This means that clients using an alternative service can change the host, port
   and protocol that they are using to fetch resources, but these changes &MUST-NOT;
   be propagated to the application that is using HTTP; from that standpoint, the
   URI being accessed and all information derived from it (scheme, host, port) are
   the same as before.
</t>
<t>
   Importantly, this includes its security context; in particular, when TLS
   <xref target="RFC5246"/> is in use, the alternative service will need to present a certificate
   for the origin's host name, not that of the alternative. Likewise, the Host
   header field (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="," x:rel="#header.host"/>) is
   still derived from the origin, not the alternative service (just as it would
   if a CNAME were being used).
</t>
<t>
  The changes &MAY;, however, be made visible in debugging tools, consoles, etc.
</t>
<t>
  Formally, an alternative service is identified by the combination of:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>An Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) protocol, as per
    <xref target="RFC7301"/></t>
    <t>A host, as per <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.2.2"/></t>
    <t>A port, as per <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="," x:sec="3.2.3"/></t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   Additionally, each alternative service &MUST; have:
  <list style="symbols">
    <t>A freshness lifetime, expressed in seconds; see <xref target="caching"/></t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
   There are many ways that a client could discover the alternative service(s)
   associated with an origin.  This document describes two such mechanisms:
   an HTTP header field (<xref target="alt-svc"/>) and an HTTP/2 frame type
   (<xref target="frame"/>).
</t>
<t>
   The remainder of this section describes requirements that are common to alternative
   services, regardless of how they are discovered.
</t>

<section title="Host Authentication" anchor="host_auth">
<t>
   Clients &MUST-NOT; use alternative services with a host that is different than the origin's
   without strong server authentication; this mitigates the attack described in
   <xref target="host_security"/>. One way to achieve this is for the alternative to use TLS
   with a certificate that is valid for that origin.
</t>
<t>
   For example, if the origin's host is "www.example.com" and an alternative is
   offered on "other.example.com" with the "h2" protocol, and the certificate
   offered is valid for "www.example.com", the client can use the alternative.
   However, if "other.example.com" is offered with the "h2c" protocol, the client
   cannot use it, because there is no mechanism in that protocol to establish
   strong server authentication.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Alternative Service Caching" anchor="caching">
<t>
   Mechanisms for discovering alternative services also associate a freshness
   lifetime with them; for example, the Alt-Svc header field uses the "ma"
   parameter.
</t>
<t>
   Clients &MAY; choose to use an alternative service instead of the origin at any
   time when it is considered fresh; see <xref target="switching"/> for specific
   recommendations.
</t>
<t>
   Clients with existing connections to an alternative service do not need to
   stop using it when its freshness lifetime ends; i.e., the caching
   mechanism is intended for limiting how long an alternative service can be used
   for establishing new requests, not limiting the use of existing ones.
</t>
<t>
   Clients ought to consider that changes in network configurations can
   result in suboptimal or compromised cached alternative services.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Requiring Server Name Indication" anchor="requiring-server-name-indication">
<t>
   A client &MUST; only use a TLS-based alternative service if the client also
   supports TLS Server Name Indication (SNI). This supports the conservation of
   IP addresses on the alternative service host.
</t>
<t>
   Note that the SNI information provided in TLS by the client will be that of the origin, not the
   alternative (as will the Host HTTP header field-value).
</t>
</section>

<section title="Using Alternative Services" anchor="switching">
<t>
   By their nature, alternative services are &OPTIONAL;: clients do not need to
   use them. However, it is advantageous for clients to behave in a predictable
   way when they are used by servers (e.g., for load balancing).
</t>
<t>
   Therefore, if a client becomes aware of an alternative service, the client
   &SHOULD; use that alternative service for all requests to the associated origin
   as soon as it is available, provided that the security properties of the
   alternative service protocol are desirable, as compared to the existing
   connection.
</t>
<t>
   If a client becomes aware of multiple alternative services, it &MAY; choose
   the most suitable according to its own criteria (again, keeping security
   properties in mind). For example, an origin might advertise multiple
   alternative services to notify clients of support for multiple versions of
   HTTP; or, an alternative service might itself advertise an alternative.
</t>
<t>
   When a client uses an alternate service, it &MUST; emit the Alt-Used
   header field (<xref target="indicator"/>) on every request using that alternate
   service.
</t>
<t>
   The client does not need to block requests on any existing connection; it can be
   used until the alternative connection is established. However, if the security
   properties of the existing connection are weak (e.g. cleartext HTTP/1.1) then
   it might make sense to block until the new connection is fully available in
   order to avoid information leakage.
</t>
<t>
   Furthermore, if the connection to the alternative service fails or is unresponsive, the client
   &MAY; fall back to using the origin or another alternative service. Note, however, that this
   could be the basis of a downgrade attack, thus losing any enhanced security properties of the
   alternative service.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section title="The Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field" anchor="alt-svc">
<t>
   An HTTP(S) origin server can advertise the availability of alternative services
   to clients by adding an Alt-Svc header field to responses.
</t>
<figure>
  <artwork type="abnf2616">
Alt-Svc       = 1#( alternative *( OWS ";" OWS parameter ) )
alternative   = protocol-id "=" alt-authority
protocol-id   = token ; percent-encoded ALPN protocol identifier
alt-authority = quoted-string ; containing [ uri-host ] ":" port
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
   ALPN protocol names are octet sequences with no
   additional constraints on format.<!-- besides length?-->
   Octets not allowed in tokens (<xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="," x:rel="#field.components"/>)
   &MUST; be percent-encoded as per <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="of" x:sec="2.1"/>.
   Consequently, the octet representing the percent character "%" (hex 25) &MUST;
   be percent-encoded as well.
</t>
<t>
   In order to have precisely one way to represent any ALPN protocol name, the following
   additional constraints apply:
   <list style="numbers">
    <t>
      Octets in the ALPN protocol &MUST-NOT; be percent-encoded if they are valid
      token characters except "%", and
    </t>
    <t>
      When using percent-encoding, uppercase hex digits &MUST; be used.
    </t>
   </list>
</t>
<t>
  With these constraints, recipients can apply simple string comparison to
  match protocol identifiers.
</t>
<t>
  The "alt-authority" component consists of an &OPTIONAL; uri-host
  ("host" in <xref target="RFC3986" x:fmt="of" x:sec="3.2.2"/>), a colon (":"),
  and a port number.
</t>
<figure>
  <preamble>For example:</preamble>
   <artwork type="example">
Alt-Svc: h2=":8000"
</artwork>
<postamble>
   This indicates the "h2" protocol (<xref target="HTTP2"/>) on the same
   host using the indicated port 8000.
</postamble>
</figure>
<figure>
  <preamble>An example involving a change of host:</preamble>
   <artwork type="example">
Alt-Svc: h2="new.example.org:80"
</artwork>
<postamble>
   This indicates the "h2" protocol on the host "new.example.org", running
   on port 80. Note that the "quoted-string" syntax needs to be used because
   ":" is not an allowed character in "token".
</postamble>
</figure>
<texttable style="all" align="left">
  <preamble>Examples for protocol name escaping:</preamble>
  <ttcol>ALPN protocol name</ttcol>
  <ttcol>protocol-id</ttcol>
  <ttcol>Note</ttcol>

  <c>h2</c>
  <c>h2</c>
  <c>No escaping needed</c>

  <c>w=x:y#z</c>
  <c>w%3Dx%3Ay#z</c>
  <c>"=" and ":" escaped</c>

  <c>x%y</c>
  <c>x%25y</c>
  <c>"%" needs escaping</c>
</texttable>
<t>
   Alt-Svc &MAY; occur in any HTTP response message, regardless of the status code.
</t>
<figure>
  <preamble>The Alt-Svc field value can have multiple values:</preamble>
  <artwork type="example">
Alt-Svc: h2c=":8000", h2=":443"
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
   The value(s) advertised by Alt-Svc can be used by clients to open a new
   connection to one or more alternative services immediately, or simultaneously
   with subsequent requests on the same connection.
</t>
<t>
   When using HTTP/2 (<xref target="HTTP2"/>), servers &SHOULD; instead send an ALTSVC frame
   (<xref target="frame"/>). A single ALTSVC frame can be sent for a connection;
   a new frame is not needed for every request.
</t>
<t>
   Note that all field elements that allow "quoted-string" syntax &MUST; be processed
   as per <xref target="RFC7230" x:fmt="of" x:rel="#field.components"/>.
</t>

<section title="Caching Alt-Svc Header Field Values" anchor="caching-alt-svc-header-field-values">
<t>
   When an alternative service is advertised using Alt-Svc, it is considered fresh
   for 24 hours from generation of the message. This can be modified with the 'ma'
   (max-age) parameter;
</t>
<figure>
  <artwork type="example">
Alt-Svc: h2=":443"; ma=3600
</artwork>
</figure>
<t>
   which indicates the number of seconds since the response was generated the
   alternative service is considered fresh for.
</t>
<figure>
  <artwork type="abnf2616">
ma = delta-seconds
</artwork></figure>
<t>
   See <xref target="RFC7234" x:rel="#age.calculations" x:fmt="of"/> for details of determining
   response age.
</t>
<figure>
  <preamble>For example, a response:</preamble>
  <artwork type="message/http; msgtype=&#34;response&#34;" x:indent-with="  ">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Cache-Control: 600
Age: 30
Alt-Svc: h2c=":8000"; ma=60
</artwork>
<postamble>
   indicates that an alternative service is available and usable for the next 60
   seconds. However, the response has already been cached for 30 seconds (as per
   the Age header field value), so therefore the alternative service is only fresh
   for the 30 seconds from when this response was received, minus estimated
   transit time.
</postamble>
</figure>
<t>
   Note that the freshness lifetime for HTTP caching (here, 600 seconds) does not
   affect caching of Alt-Svc values.
</t>
<t>
   When an Alt-Svc response header field is received from an origin, its value
   invalidates and replaces all cached alternative services for that origin.
</t>
<t>
   See <xref target="caching"/> for general requirements on caching alternative services.
</t>
</section>
</section>

<section anchor="frame" title="The ALTSVC HTTP/2 Frame">
<t>
  The ALTSVC HTTP/2 frame (<xref target="HTTP2" x:fmt="," x:rel="#FramingLayer"/>)
  advertises the availability of an alternative service to an HTTP/2 client.
</t>
<t>
  The ALTSVC frame is a non-critical extension to HTTP/2.  Endpoints that do
  not support this frame can safely ignore it.
</t>
<t>
  An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on a client-initiated stream indicates that the
  conveyed alternative service is associated with the origin of that stream.
</t>
<t>
  An ALTSVC frame from a server to a client on stream 0 indicates that the conveyed alternative
  service is associated with the origin contained in the Origin field of the frame. An association
  with an origin that the client does not consider authoritative for the current connection &MUST;
  be ignored.

<t>
  The ALTSVC frame type is 0xa (decimal 10).

<t>
  The ALTSVC frame contains the following fields:
  <list style="hanging">
    <t hangText="Origin-Len:">
      An unsigned, 8-bit integer indicating the length, in octets, of the Origin header field.
    </t>
    <t hangText="Origin:">
      An &OPTIONAL; sequence of characters (length determined by <spanx
      style="verb">Origin-Len</spanx>) containing the ASCII serialization of an origin (<xref

    <t hangTest="Value:">
      A sequence of characters (length determined by subtracting the length of all preceding fields

    </t>
  </list>
</t>
<t>
  The ALTSVC frame does not define any flags.
</t>
<t>
  The ALTSVC frame is intended for receipt by clients; a server that receives an
  ALTSVC frame &MUST; treat it as a connection error of type PROTOCOL_ERROR.
</t>
<t>
  An ALTSVC frame on a client-initiated stream containing non-empty "Origin" information 
  is invalid and &MUST; be ignored. Likewise, an ALTSVC frame on stream 0 with
  empty (length 0) "Origin" information is invalid and &MUST; be ignored.
</t>
<t>
  The ALTSVC frame is processed hop-by-hop.  An intermediary &MUST-NOT; forward ALTSVC frames,
  though it can use the information contained in ALTSVC frames in forming new ALTSVC frames
  to send to its own clients.
</t>

   When using an alternative service, clients &MUST; include a Alt-Used
   header field in all requests.
</t>
<t>
   A flag value of "1" indicates that an alternate service was used,
   while "0" means it was not.

   The 421 (Misdirected Request) status code is defined in <xref target="HTTP2"
   x:fmt="of" x:rel="#MisdirectedRequest"/> to indicate that the current server

   Clients receiving 421 (Misdirected Request) from an alternative service &MUST;
   remove the corresponding entry from its alternative service cache (see <xref

   request method, they &MAY; retry the request, either at another alternative
   server, or at the origin.

<section title="Security Considerations" anchor="security-considerations">

<section title="Changing Ports" anchor="changing-ports">
<t>
   Using an alternative service implies accessing an origin's resources on an
   alternative port, at a minimum. An attacker that can inject alternative services
   and listen at the advertised port is therefore able to hijack an origin.
</t>
<t>
   For example, an attacker that can add HTTP response header fields can redirect
   traffic to a different port on the same host using the Alt-Svc header field; if
   that port is under the attacker's control, they can thus masquerade as the HTTP
   server.
</t>
<t>
   This risk can be mitigated by restricting the ability to advertise alternative
   services, and restricting who can open a port for listening on that host.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changing Hosts" anchor="host_security">
<t>
   When the host is changed due to the use of an alternative service, it presents
   an opportunity for attackers to hijack communication to an origin.
</t>
<t>
   For example, if an attacker can convince a user agent to send all traffic for
   "innocent.example.org" to "evil.example.com" by successfully associating it as an alternative
   service, they can masquerade as that origin. This can be done locally (see mitigations in <xref
   target="changing-ports"/>) or remotely (e.g., by an intermediary as a man-in-the-middle attack).
</t>
<t>
   This is the reason for the requirement in <xref target="host_auth"/> that any alternative
   service with a host different to the origin's be strongly authenticated with
   the origin's identity; i.e., presenting a certificate for the origin proves
   that the alternative service is authorized to serve traffic for the origin.
</t>
<t>
   However, this authorization is only as strong as the method used to
   authenticate the alternative service. In particular, there are well-known
   exploits to make an attacker's certificate appear as legitimate.
</t>
<t>
   Alternative services could be used to persist such an attack; for example, an
   intermediary could man-in-the-middle TLS-protected communication to a target,
   and then direct all traffic to an alternative service with a large freshness
   lifetime, so that the user agent still directs traffic to the attacker even when
   not using the intermediary.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Changing Protocols" anchor="changing-protocols">
<t>
   When the ALPN protocol is changed due to the use of an alternative service, the
   security properties of the new connection to the origin can be different from
   that of the "normal" connection to the origin, because the protocol identifier
   itself implies this.
</t>
<t>
   For example, if a "https://" URI had a protocol advertised that does not use
   some form of end-to-end encryption (most likely, TLS), it violates the
   expectations for security that the URI scheme implies.
</t>
<t>
   Therefore, clients cannot blindly use alternative services, but instead evaluate
   the option(s) presented to assure that security requirements and expectations
   (of specifications, implementations and end users) are met.
</t>
</section>

<section title="Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services" anchor="tracking">
<t>
   Choosing an alternative service implies connecting to a new, server-supplied
   host name. By using many different (potentially unique) host names, servers
   could conceivably track client requests.
</t>
<t>
   Clients concerned by the additional fingerprinting can choose to ignore alternative
   service advertisements.
</t>
<t>
   In a browser, any alternative service information &MUST; be removed when origin-specific data
   is cleared (for instance, when cookies are cleared).
