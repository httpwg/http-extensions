--- abstract

The mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol over a single stream
of an HTTP/2 connection is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but the HTTP
version-specific details need to be specified. This document describes
how the mechanism is adapted for HTTP/3.

# Introduction

{{!RFC8441}} defines an extension to HTTP/2 which is also useful in HTTP/3.
This extension makes use of an HTTP/2 setting.  {{Appendix A.3 of HTTP3}}
describes the required updates for HTTP/2 settings to be used with HTTP/3.

# Websockets Upgrade over HTTP/3

{{!RFC8441}} defines a mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol
{{!RFC6455}} over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection. It defines
an Extended CONNECT method which specifies a new ":protocol" pseudo
header field and new semantics for the ":path" and ":authority" pseudo
header fields. It also defines a new HTTP/2 setting sent by a server to
allow the client to use  Extended CONNECT.

The HTTP/3 stream closure is also analogous to the TCP connection
closure of {{!RFC6455}}. Orderly TCP-level closures are represented as
a FIN bit on the stream ({{Section 4.2 of HTTP3}}). RST exceptions are
represented with an stream error ({{Section 8 of HTTP3}}) of type
H3_REQUEST_CANCELLED ({{Section 8.1 of HTTP3}}).

The semantics of the headers and setting are identical to those
in HTTP/2 as defined {{!RFC8441}}. {{Appendix A.3 of HTTP3}} requires that
HTTP/3 settings be registered separately for HTTP/3. The
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL value is 0x08 (decimal 8), as in HTTP/2.

If a server which advertises support for Extended CONNECT but receives an
Extended CONNECT request with a ":protocol" value that is unknown or is
not supported, the server SHOULD respond to the request with a 501 (Not
Implemented) status code ({{Section 15.6.2 of HTTP}}). A server MAY
provide more information via a Problem Details response {{!RFC7807}}.

# Security Considerations

This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
discussed in {{!RFC8841}}.

# IANA Considerations

This document registers a new setting in the "HTTP/3 Settings"
registry ([HTTP3]).
