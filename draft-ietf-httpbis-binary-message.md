# Introduction

This document defines a simple format for representing an HTTP message
({{HTTP}}), either request or response. This allows for the encoding of HTTP
messages that can be conveyed outside of an HTTP protocol. This enables the
transformation of entire messages, including the application of authenticated
encryption.

This format is informed by the framing structure of HTTP/2 ({{H2}})
and HTTP/3 ({{?H3=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}). In comparison, this format simpler by
virtue of not including either header compression ({{?HPACK=RFC7541}},
{{?QPACK=I-D.ietf-quic-qpack}}) or a generic framing layer.

This format provides an alternative to the `message/http` content type defined
in {{MESSAGING}}. A binary format permits more efficient encoding and processing
of messages. A binary format also reduces exposure to security problems related
to processing of HTTP messages.

Two modes for encoding are described:

* a known-length encoding includes length prefixes for all major message
  components; and

* an indefinite-length encoding enables efficient generation of messages where
  lengths are not known when encoding starts.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This document uses terminology from HTTP ({{HTTP}}) and notation from QUIC
({{Section 1.3 of QUIC}}).


# Format

{{Section 6 of HTTP}} defines five distinct parts to HTTP messages.  A framing
indicator is added to signal how these parts are composed:

1. Framing indicator. This format uses a single integer to describe framing, which describes
   whether the message is a request or response and how subsequent sections are
   formatted; see {{framing}}.

2. For a response, any number of interim responses, each consisting of an
   informational status code and header section.

3. Control data. For a request, this contains the request method and target.
   For a response, this contains the status code.

4. Header section.  This contains zero or more header fields.

5. Content.  This is a sequence of zero or more bytes.

6. Trailer section.  This contains zero or more trailer fields.

All lengths and numeric values are encoded using the variable-length integer
encoding from {{Section 16 of QUIC}}.


## Known Length Messages

A message that has a known length at the time of construction uses the
format shown in {{format-known-length}}.

~~~ quic-format
Message with Known-Length {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 0..1,
  Known-Length Informational Response (..) ...,
  Control Data (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
  Known-Length Content (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
}

Known-Length Field Section {
  Length (i) = 2..,
  Field Line (..) ...,
}

Known-Length Content {
  Content Length (i),
  Content (..)
}

Known-Length Informational Response {
  Informational Response Control Data (..),
  Known-Length Field Section (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-known-length title="Known-Length Message"}

That is, a known-length message consists of a framing indicator, a block of
control data that is formatted according to the value of the framing indicator,
a header section with a length prefix, binary content with a length prefix, and
a trailer section with a length prefix.

Response messages that contain informational status codes result in a different
structure; see {{informational}}.

Fields in the header and trailer sections consist of a length-prefixed name and
length-prefixed value. Both name and value are sequences of bytes that cannot
be zero length.

The format allows for the message to be truncated before any of the length
prefixes that precede the field sections or content. This reduces the overall
message size. A message that is truncated at any other point is invalid; see
{{invalid}}.

The variable-length integer encoding means that there is a limit of 2^62-1
bytes for each field section and the message content.


## Indeterminate Length Messages

A message that is constructed without encoding a known length for each section
uses the format shown in {{format-indeterminate-length}}:

~~~ quic-format
Indeterminate-Length Message  {
  Framing Indicator (i) = 2..3,
  Indeterminate-Length Informational Response (..) ...,
  Control Data (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Content (..) ...,
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
}

Indeterminate-Length Content {
  Indeterminate-Length Content Chunk (..) ...,
  Content Terminator (i) = 0,
}

Indeterminate-Length Content Chunk {
  Chunk Length (i) = 1..,
  Chunk (..)
}

Indeterminate-Length Field Section {
  Field Line (..) ...,
  Content Terminator (i) = 0,
}

Indeterminate-Length Informational Response {
  Informational Response Control Data (..),
  Indeterminate-Length Field Section (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-indeterminate-length title="Indeterminate-Length Message"}

That is, an indeterminate length consists of a framing indicator, a block of
control data that is formatted according to the value of the framing indicator,
a header section that is terminated by a zero value, any number of
non-zero-length chunks of binary content, a zero value, and a trailer section
that is terminated by a zero value.

Response messages that contain informational status codes result in a different
structure; see {{informational}}.

Indeterminate-length messages can be truncated in a similar way as known-length
messages. Truncation occurs after the control data, or after the Content
Terminator field that ends a field section or sequence of content chunks. A
message that is truncated at any other point is invalid; see {{invalid}}.

Indeterminate-length messages use the same encoding for field lines as
known-length messages; see {{fields}}.


## Framing Indicator {#framing}

The start of each is a framing indicator that is a single integer that
describes the structure of the subsequent sections. The framing indicator can
take just four values:

* A value of 0 describes a request of known length.
* A value of 1 describes a response of known length.
* A value of 2 describes a request of indeterminate length.
* A value of 3 describes a response of indeterminate length.

Other values cause the message to be invalid; see {{invalid}}.


## Request Control Data

The control data for a request message includes four values that correspond to
the values of the `:method`, `:scheme`, `:authority`, and `:path` pseudo-header
fields described in HTTP/2 ({{Section 8.3.1 of H2}}). These fields are
encoded, each with a length prefix, in the order listed.

The rules in {{Section 8.3 of H2}} for constructing pseudo-header fields
apply to the construction of these values. However, where the `:authority`
pseudo-header field might be omitted in HTTP/2, a zero-length value is encoded
instead.

The format of request control data is shown in {{format-request-control-data}}.

~~~ quic-format
Request Control Data {
  Method Length (i),
  Method (..),
  Scheme Length (i),
  Scheme (..),
  Authority Length (i),
  Authority (..),
  Path Length (i),
  Path (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-request-control-data title="Format of Request Control Data"}


## Response Control Data

The control data for a request message includes a single field that corresponds
to the `:status` pseudo-header field in HTTP/2; see {{Section 8.3.2 of
H2}}. This field is encoded as a single variable length integer, not a decimal
string.

The format of final response control data is shown in
{{format-response-control-data}}.

~~~ quic-format
Final Response Control Data {
  Status Code (i) = 200..599,
}
~~~
{: #format-response-control-data title="Format of Final Response Control Data"}


### Informational Status Codes {#informational}

Responses that include information status codes (see {{Section 15.2 of HTTP}})
are encoded by repeating the response control data and associated header section
until the final status code is encoded.

The format of the informational response control data is shown in
{{format-informational}}.

~~~ quic-format
Informational Response Control Data {
  Status Code (i) = 100..199,
}
~~~
{: #format-informational title="Format of Informational Response Control Data"}

A response message can include any number of informational responses. If the
response control data includes an informational status code (that is, a value
between 100 and 199 inclusive), the control data is followed by a header
section (encoded with known- or indeterminate- length according to the framing
indicator). After the header section, another response control data block
follows.


## Header and Trailer Field Lines {#fields}

Header and trailer sections consist of zero or more field lines; see {{Section 5
of HTTP}}. The format of a field section depends on whether the message is
known- or intermediate-length.

Each field line includes a name and a value. Both the name and value are
sequences of bytes, with the name including at least one byte. The format of a
field line is shown in {{format-field-line}}.

~~~ quic-format
Field Line {
  Name Length (i) = 1..,
  Name (..),
  Value Length (i),
  Value (..),
}
~~~
{: #format-field-line title="Format of a Field Line"}

For field names, byte values that are not permitted in an HTTP field name cause
the message to be invalid; see {{Section 5.1 of HTTP}} for a definition of
what is valid and {{invalid}} for handling of invalid messages.

Field names and values MUST be constructed and validated according to the rules
of {{Section 8.2.1 of H2}}.  A recipient MUST treat a message that contains
field values that would cause an HTTP/2 message to be malformed ({{Section 8.1.1
of H2}}) as invalid; see {{invalid}}.

The same field name can be repeated in multiple field lines; see {{Section 5.2 of
HTTP}} for the semantics of repeated field names and rules for combining
values.

Like HTTP/2, this format has an exception for the combination of multiple
instances of the `Cookie` field. Instances of fields with the ASCII-encoded
value of `cookie` are combined using a semicolon octet (0x3b) rather than a
comma; see {{Section 8.2.3 of H2}}.

This format provides fixed locations for content that would be carried in HTTP/2
pseudo-fields. Therefore, there is no need to include field lines containing a
name of `:method`, `:scheme`, `:authority`, `:path`, or `:status`.  Fields that
contain one of these names cause the message to be invalid; see
{{invalid}}. Pseudo-fields that are defined by protocol extensions MAY be
included.  Field lines containing pseudo-fields MUST precede other field lines;
a message that contains a pseudo-field after any other field is invalid; see
{{invalid}}.


## Content

The content of messages is a sequence of bytes of any length. Though a
known-length message has a limit, this limit is large enough that it is
unlikely to be a practical limitation. There is no limit to the size of content
in an indeterminate length message.

Omitting content by truncating a message is only possible if the content is
zero-length.


# Invalid Messages {#invalid}

This document describes a number of ways that a message can be invalid. Invalid
messages MUST NOT be processed except to log an error and produce an error
response.

The format is designed to allow incremental processing. Implementations need to
be aware of the possibility that an error might be detected after performing
incremental processing.


# Examples

This section includes example requests and responses encoded in both
known-length and indefinite-length forms.

## Request Example

The example HTTP/1.1 message in {{ex-request}} shows the content of a
`message/http`.

Valid HTTP/1.1 messages require lines terminated with CRLF (the two bytes 0x0a
and 0x0d). For simplicity and consistency, the content of these examples is
limited to text, which also uses CRLF for line endings.

~~~ http-message
GET /hello.txt HTTP/1.1
User-Agent: curl/7.16.3 libcurl/7.16.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7l zlib/1.2.3
Host: www.example.com
Accept-Language: en, mi

~~~
{: #ex-request title="Sample HTTP Request"}

This can be expressed as a binary message (type `message/bhttp`) using a
known-length encoding as shown in hexadecimal in {{ex-bink-request}}.
{{ex-bink-request}} view includes some of the text alongside to show that most
of the content is not modified.

~~~ hex-dump
00034745 54056874 74707300 0a2f6865  ..GET.https../he

~~~
{: #ex-bink-request title="Known-Length Binary Encoding of Request"}

This example shows that the Host header field is not replicated in the
:authority field, as is required for ensuring that the request is reproduced
accurately; see {{Section 8.3.1 of H2}}.

The same message can be truncated with no effect on interpretation. In this
case, the last two bytes - corresponding to content and a trailer section - can
each be removed without altering the semantics of the message.

The same message, encoded using an indefinite-length encoding is shown in
{{ex-bini-request}}. As the content of this message is empty, the difference in
formats is negligible.

~~~ hex-dump
02034745 54056874 74707300 0a2f6865  ..GET.https../he

~~~
{: #ex-bini-request title="Indefinite-Length Binary Encoding of Request"}

This indefinite-length encoding can be truncated by two bytes in the same way.


## Response Example

Response messages can contain interim (1xx) status codes as the message in
{{ex-response}} shows. {{ex-response}} includes examples of informational
status codes defined in {{?RFC2518}} and {{?RFC8297}}.

~~~ http-message

phrase is not retained by this encoding.

{: #ex-bini-response title="Binary Response including Interim Responses"}

A response that uses the chunked encoding (see {{Section 7.1 of MESSAGING}}) as
shown for {{ex-chunked}} can be encoded using indefinite-length encoding, which
minimizes buffering needed to translate into the binary format. However, chunk
boundaries do not need to be retained and any chunk extensions cannot be
conveyed using the binary format.

# Security Considerations {#security}

Many of the considerations that apply to HTTP message handling apply to this
format; see {{Section 17 of HTTP}} and {{Section 11 of MESSAGING}} for common
issues in handling HTTP messages.

Strict parsing of the format with no tolerance for errors can help avoid a
number of attacks. However, implementations still need to be aware of the
possibility of resource exhaustion attacks that might arise from receiving
large messages, particularly those with large numbers of fields.

The format is designed to allow for minimal state when translating for use with
HTTP proper. However, producing a combined value for fields, which might be
necessary for the `Cookie` field when translating this format (like HTTP/1.1
{{MESSAGING}}), can require the commitment of resources. Implementations need
to ensure that they aren't subject to resource exhaustion attack from a
maliciously crafted message.


# IANA Considerations

Please add the "Media Types" registry at
<https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types> with the registration
information in {{media-type}} for the media type "message/bhttp".
