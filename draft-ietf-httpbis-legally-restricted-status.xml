    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>This document specifies a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 
      status code for use when a server operator has a received a legal demand
      to deny access to a resource.</t>

      <t>This status code may be used to provide transparency
      in circumstances where issues of law or public policy affect server
      operations. This transparency may be beneficial both to these operators
      and to end users.</t>
      <t><xref target="RFC4924"/> discusses the forces working
      against transparent operation of the Internet; these clearly include
      legal interventions to restrict access to content.  As that document
      notes, and as Section 4 of <xref target="RFC4084"/> states, such
      restrictions should be made explicit.</t>
      
      <t>Feedback should occur on the ietf-http-wg@w3.org mailing list.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
      this document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>


    <section title="451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons">
      <t>This status code indicates that the server is denying access
      to the resource as a consequence of a legal demand.</t> 
      
      <t>The server in question may not be an origin server.  This type of
      legal demand typically most directly affects the operations of ISPs and
      search engines.</t>

      <t>Responses using this status code SHOULD include an explanation,
      in the response body, of the details of the legal demand: the party
      making it, the applicable legislation or regulation, and what classes of
      person and resource it applies
      to.  For example:</t>

      <figure><artwork type="example">
HTTP/1.1 451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons
Content-Type: text/html

&lt;html>
 &lt;head>&lt;title>Unavailable For Legal Reasons&lt;/title>&lt;/head>
 &lt;body>
  &lt;h1>Unavailable For Legal Reasons&lt;/h1>
  &lt;p>This request may not be serviced in the Roman Province 
  of Judea due to the Lex Julia Majestatis, which disallows 
  access to resources hosted on servers deemed to be 
  operated by the People's Front of Judea.&lt;/p>
 &lt;/body>
&lt;/html></artwork></figure>

<t>The use of the 451 status code implies neither the existence nor
non-existence of the resource named in the request. That is to say,
it is possible that if the legal demands were removed,
a request for the resource still might not succeed.</t>

<t>Note that in many cases clients can still access the denied resource by
using technical countermeasures such as a VPN or the Tor network.</t>

<t>A 451 response is cacheable by default; i.e., unless otherwise indicated by the method definition or explicit cache controls; see <xref target="RFC7234"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Security Considerations">

      <section title="451 Unavailable for Legal Reasons">
	<t>The 451 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its
	use. It is possible that certain legal authorities may wish
	to avoid transparency, and not only demand the restriction of access 
        to certain resources, but also avoid disclosing that the demand 
        was made.  </t>
      </section>


    </section>

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>The HTTP Status Codes Registry should be updated with the
      following entries:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
	<t>Code: 451</t>
	<t>Description: Unavailable for Legal Reasons</t>
	<t>Specification: [ this document ]</t>
      </list></t>

      <t>Thanks to Terence Eden, who observed that the existing
      status code 403 was not really suitable for this situation, and
      suggested the creation of a new status code.</t>
      <t>Thanks also to Ray Bradbury.</t>
