Abstract

   The Repr-Digest and Content-Digest integrity fields are subject to
   HTTP content coding considerations.  There are some use cases that
   benefit from the unambiguous exchange of integrity digests of
   unencoded representation.  The Unencoded-Digest and Want-Unencoded-
   Digest fields complement existing integrity fields for this purpose.

1.  Introduction

   The Repr-Digest and Content-Digest integrity fields defined in
   [DIGEST-FIELDS] are suitable for a range of use cases.  However,
   because the fields are subject to HTTP content coding considerations,
   it is difficult to support use cases that could benefit from the
   exchange of integrity digests of the unencoded representation.

   As a simple example, an application using HTTP might be presented
   with request or response representation data that has been
   transparently decoded.  Attempting to verify the integrity of the
   data against the Repr-Digest would first require re-encoding that
   data using the same coding indicated by the Content-Encoding header
   field (Section 8.4 of [HTTP]), which is not always possible (see
   Section 6.5 of [DIGEST-FIELDS]).

   Although receivers could feasibly re-encode data in order to carry
   out Repr-Digest validation, it might be impractical for certain kinds
   of environments.  For instance, browsers tend to provide built-in
   support for transparent decoding but little support for encoding;
   while this could be done via the use of additional libraries it would
   create work in JavaScript that could contend with other activities.
   Even on the server side, the re-encoding of received data might not
   be acceptable; some coding algorithms are optimized towards efficient
   decoding at the cost of complex encoding.  A Content-Encoding field
   value that indicates a series of encodings adds further complexity.

   A more complex example involves HTTP Range Requests (Section 14 of
   [HTTP]), where a client fetches multiple partial representations from
   different origins and "stitches" them back into a whole.
   Unfortunately, if the origins apply different content coding, the
   Repr-Digest field will vary by the server's selected encoding (i.e.
   the Content-Encoding header field, Section 8.4 of [HTTP]).  This
   provides a challenge for a client - in order to verify the integrity
   of the pieced-together whole it would need to remove the encoding of
   each part, combine them, and then encode the result in order to
   compare against one or more Repr-Digests.

   The Accept-Encoding header field (Section 12.5.3 of [HTTP]) provides
   the means to indicate preferences for content coding.  It is possible
   for an endpoint to indicate a preference for no encoding, for example
   by sending the "identity" token.  However, codings often provide data
   compression that is advantageous.  Disabling content coding in order
   to simplify integrity checking is possibly an unacceptable trade off.

   For a variety of reasons, decoding and re-encoding content in order
   to benefit from HTTP integrity fields is not preferable.  This
   specification defines the Unencoded-Digest and Want-Unencoded-Digest
   fields to support a simpler validation workflow in some scenarios
   where content coding is applied.  These fields complement the other
   integrity fields defined in [DIGEST-FIELDS].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the Augmented BNF defined in [RFC5234] and updated
   by [RFC7405].  This includes the rules: LF (line feed)

   This document uses the following terminology from Section 3 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] to specify syntax and parsing: Byte Sequence,
   Dictionary, and Integer.

   The definitions "representation", "selected representation",
   "representation data", "representation metadata", and "content" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in [HTTP].

   "Integrity fields" is the collective term for Content-Digest, Repr-
   Digest, and Unencoded-Digest.

   "Integrity preference fields" is the collective term for Want-Repr-
   Digest, Want-Content-Digest, and Want-Unencoded-Digest.

3.  The Unencoded-Digest Field

   The Unencoded-Digest HTTP field can be used in requests and responses
   to communicate digests that are calculated using a hashing algorithm
   applied to the representation with no content coding (Section 8.4.1
   of [HTTP]).

   Apart from the content coding concerns, Unencoded-Digest behaves
   similarly to Repr-Digest (Section 3 of [DIGEST-FIELDS]).  In the
   absence of content coding, Unencoded-Digest is identical to Repr-
   Digest.

   Unencoded-Digest is a Dictionary (see Section 3.2 of
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) where each:

   *  key conveys the hashing algorithm (see Section 5 of
      [DIGEST-FIELDS]) used to compute the digest;

   *  value is a Byte Sequence (Section 3.3.5 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]),
      that conveys an encoded version of the byte output produced by the
      digest calculation.

      Each Dictionary value can have zero or more Parameters
      (Section 3.1.2 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  This specification does
      not define any Parameters but extensions MAY define them.  Unknown
      Parameters MUST be ignored.

   For example:

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   Unencoded-Digest: \
     sha-512=:YMAam51Jz/jOATT6/zvHrLVgOYTGFy1d6GJiOHTohq4yP+pgk4vf2aCs\
     yRZOtw8MjkM7iw7yZ/WkppmM44T3qg==:

   The Dictionary type can be used, for example, to attach multiple
   digests calculated using different hashing algorithms in order to
   support a population of endpoints with different or evolving
   capabilities.  Such an approach could support transitions away from
   weaker algorithms (see Section 6.6 of [DIGEST-FIELDS]).

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   Unencoded-Digest: \
     sha-256=:d435Qo+nKZ+gLcUHn7GQtQ72hiBVAgqoLsZnZPiTGPk=:,\
     sha-512=:YMAam51Jz/jOATT6/zvHrLVgOYTGFy1d6GJiOHTohq4yP+pgk4vf2aCs\
     yRZOtw8MjkM7iw7yZ/WkppmM44T3qg==:

   A recipient MAY ignore any or all digests.  Application-specific
   behavior or local policy MAY set additional constraints on the
   processing and validation practices of the conveyed digests.  The
   security considerations cover some of the issues related to ignoring
   digests (see Section 6.6 of [DIGEST-FIELDS]) and validating multiple
   digests (see Section 6.7 of [DIGEST-FIELDS]).

   A sender MAY send a digest without knowing whether the recipient
   supports a given hashing algorithm.  A sender MAY send a digest if it
   knows the recipient will ignore it.

   Unencoded-Digest can be sent in a trailer section.  In this case,
   Unencoded-Digest MAY be merged into the header section; see
   Section 6.5.1 of [HTTP].

4.  The Want-Unencoded-Digest Field

   Want-Unencoded-Digest is an integrity preference field; see Section 4
   of [DIGEST-FIELDS].  It indicates that the sender would like to
   receive (via the Unencoded-Digest field) a representation digest on
   messages associated with the request URI and representation metadata
   where no content coding is applied.

   If Want-Unencoded-Digest is used in a response, it indicates that the
   server would like the client to provide the Unencoded-Digest field on
   future requests.

   Want-Unencoded-Digest is only a hint.  The receiver of the field can
   ignore it and send an Unencoded-Digest field using any algorithm or
   omit one entirely.  It is not a protocol error if preferences are
   ignored.  Applications that use Unencoded-Digest and Want-Unencoded-
   Digest can define expectations or constraints that operate in
   addition to this specification.

   Want-Unencoded-Digest is of type Dictionary where each:

   *  key conveys the hashing algorithm;

   *  value is an Integer (Section 3.3.1 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]) that
      conveys an ascending, relative, weighted preference.  It must be
      in the range 0 to 10 inclusive. 1 is the least preferred, 10 is
      the most preferred, and a value of 0 means "not acceptable".

      Each Dictionary value can have zero or more Parameters
      (Section 3.1.2 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  This specification does
      not define any Parameters but extensions MAY define them.  Unknown
      Parameters MUST be ignored.

   Examples:

   Want-Unencoded-Digest: sha-256=1
   Want-Unencoded-Digest: sha-512=3, sha-256=10, unixsum=0

5.  Messages containing both Unencoded-Digest and Content-Encoding

   Digests delivered through Unencoded-Digest apply to the unencoded
   representation.  If a message is received with content coding, a
   recipient needs to decode the message in order to calculate the
   digest that can subsequently be used for validation.  If multiple
   content codings are applied, the recipient needs to decode all
   encodings in order before validation.

   Since the digest is calculated on unencoded representation bytes,
   validation of a message with content coding (as described above) can
   only succeed where the decoded output produces the same byte sequence
   as the input.  While many registered content codings behave this way,
   there is no requirement for them to do so and it remains a
   possibility that decoding could produce a different byte sequence.
   In order to avoid unintended validation failures, care is advised
   when selecting content coding for use with Unencoded-Digest.

6.  Integrity Fields are Complementary

   Integrity fields can be used in combination to address different and
   complementary needs, particularly the cases described in Section 1.

   In the following examples, the unencoded response data is the string
   "An unexceptional string" following by an LF.

   The first example demonstrates a request that uses content
   negotiation.

   GET /boringstring HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept-Encoding: gzip

               Figure 1: GET request with content negotiation

   The server responds with the full GZIP-encoded representation.  The
   Repr-Digest and Unencoded-Digest therefore differ.

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Encoding: gzip
   Repr-Digest: \
     sha-256=:XyjvEuFb1P5rqc2le3vQm7M96DwZhvmOwqHLu2xVpY4=:
   Unencoded-Digest: \
     sha-256=:5Bv3NIx05BPnh0jMph6v1RJ5Q7kl9LKMtQxmvc9+Z7Y=:

   1f 8b 08 00 79 1f 08 64 00 ff
   73 cc 53 28 cd 4b ad 48 4e 2d
   28 c9 cc cf 4b cc 51 28 2e 29
   ca cc 4b e7 02 00 7e af 07 44
   18 00 00 00

              Figure 2: GET response with GZIP-encoded content

   The second example demonstrates a range request with content
   negotiation.

   GET /boringstring HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.org
   Accept-Encoding: gzip
   Range: bytes=0-10

              Figure 3: Range request with content negotiation

   The server responds with a 206 Partial Content response using GZIP
   encoding, it has three different Integrity fields.  The Content-
   Digest relates to the response message content that can be used to
   validate the integrity of the received part.  Repr-Digest and
   Unencoded-Digest can be used later once the entire object is
   reconstructed.  The choice of which to use is left to the application
   that would consider a range of factors outside the scope of this
   document.

   NOTE: '\' line wrapping per RFC 8792

   HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content

7.  Security Considerations

   All the same considerations documented in [DIGEST-FIELDS] apply.

   This document introduces a further consideration related to the
   process of validation when an HTTP message contains both Content-
   Encoding and Unencoded-Digest (Section 5).  In order to validate the
   Unencoded-Digest, encoded content needs to be decoded.  This provides
   an opportunity for an attacker to direct malicious data into a
   decoder.  One possible mitigation would be to also provide a Content-
   Digest or Repr-Digest in the message, allowing for validation of the
   received bytes before further processing.  An attacker that can
   substitute various parts of an HTTP message presents several risks,
   Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 of [DIGEST-FIELDS] describe relevant
   considerations and mitigations.

8.  IANA Considerations

   Should this document be adopted and achieve working group consensus,
   IANA is asked to update the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field
   Name Registry" [HTTP] as shown in the table below:

    +=======================+===========+============+===============+
    | Field Name            | Status    | Structured | Reference     |
    |                       |           | Type       |               |

Acknowledgments

   Early drafts of [DIGEST-FIELDS] included a mechanism to support the
   exchange of digests where no content coding is applied, which was
   removed before publication.  While the design here is different, it
   is motivated by discussion of the previous design in the HTTP WG.
   The motivating use cases still mostly apply identically.
