# Introduction

TLS 1.3 {{?TLS13=I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}} introduces the concept of early data
(also known as zero round trip data or 0-RTT data). Early data allows a client to send data
to a server in the first round trip of a connection, without waiting for the
TLS handshake to complete if the client has spoken to the same server recently.

When used with HTTP {{!HTTP=RFC7230}}, early data allows clients to send
requests immediately, avoiding the one or two round trip delay needed for the
TLS handshake. This is a significant performance enhancement; however, it has
significant limitations.

The primary risk of using early data is that an attacker might capture and
replay the request(s) it contains. TLS {{!TLS13}} describes techniques that can
be used to reduce the likelihood that an attacker can successfully replay a
request, but these techniques can be difficult to deploy, and still leave some
possibility of a successful attack.

Note that this is different from automated or user-initiated retries; replays
are initiated by an attacker without the awareness of the client.

To help mitigate the risk of replays in HTTP, this document gives an overview
of techniques for controlling these risks in servers, and defines requirements
for clients when sending requests in early data.

The advice in this document also applies to use of 0-RTT in HTTP over QUIC
{{?HQ=I-D.ietf-quic-http}}.


## Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Early Data in HTTP

Conceptually, early data is concatenated with other application data to form a
single stream.  This can mean that requests are entirely contained within early
data, or only part of a request is early.  In a multiplexed protocol, like
HTTP/2 {{?RFC7540}} or HTTP/QUIC {{?HQ}}, multiple requests might be partially
delivered in early data.

The model that this document assumes is that once the TLS handshake completes,
the early data received on that TLS connection is known to not be a replayed copy
of that data.  However, it is important to note that this does not mean that
early data will not be or has not been replayed on another connection.


# Supporting Early Data in HTTP Servers

A server decides whether or not to offer a client the ability to send early
data on future connections when sending the TLS session ticket.

When a server enables early data, there are a number of techniques it can use
to mitigate the risks of replay:

1. TLS {{?TLS13}} mandates the use of replay detection strategies that reduce
   the ability of an attacker to successfully replay early data.  These
   anti-replay techniques reduce but don't completely eliminate the chance of
   data being replayed and ensure a fixed upper limit to the number of replays.

2. The server can choose whether it will process early data before the TLS
   handshake completes. By deferring processing, it can ensure that only a
   successfully completed connection is used for the request(s) therein.
   This provides the server with some assurance that the early data was not
   replayed.

3. If the server receives multiple requests in early data, it can determine
   whether to defer HTTP processing on a per-request basis.

4. The server can cause a client to retry a request and not use early data by
   responding with the 425 (Too Early) status code ({{status}}), in cases where
   the risk of replay is judged too great.


For a given request, the level of tolerance to replay risk is specific to the
resource it operates upon (and therefore only known to the origin server). In
general, if processing a request does not have state-changing side effects, the
consequences of replay are not significant.

The request method's safety ({{!RFC7231}}, Section 4.2.1) is one way to
determine this. However, some resources do elect to associate side effects with
safe methods, so this cannot be universally relied upon.

It is RECOMMENDED that origin servers allow resources to explicitly configure
whether early data is appropriate in requests. Absent such explicit information,
origin servers MUST either reject early data or implement the techniques
described in this document for ensuring that requests are not processed prior to
TLS handshake completion.

A request might be sent partially in early data with the remainder of the
request being sent after the handshake completes.  This does not necessarily
affect handling of that request; what matters is when the server starts acting
upon the contents of a request.  Any time any server instance might initiate
processing prior to completion of the handshake, all server instances need to
consider how a possible replay of early data could affect that processing (see
also {{be-consistent}}).

A server can partially process requests that are incomplete.  Parsing header
fields - without acting on the values - and determining request routing is
likely to be safe from side-effects, but other actions might not be.

Intermediary servers do not have sufficient information to make this
determination, so {{status}} describes a way for the origin to signal to them
that a particular request isn't appropriate for early data. Intermediaries that
accept early data MUST implement that mechanism.

Note that a server cannot choose to selectively reject early data at the TLS
layer. TLS only permits a server to accept all early data, or none of it. Once
a server has decided to accept early data, it MUST process all requests in
early data, even if the server rejects the request by sending a 425 (Too Early)
response.

A server can limit the amount of early data with the `max_early_data_size`
field of the `early_data` TLS extension. This can be used to avoid committing
an arbitrary amount of memory for deferred requests. A server SHOULD ensure
that when it accepts early data, it can defer processing of requests until
after the TLS handshake completes.


# Using Early Data in HTTP Clients

A client that wishes to use early data commences sending HTTP requests
immediately after sending the TLS ClientHello.

By their nature, clients have control over whether a given request is sent in
early data -- thereby giving the client control over risk of replay. Absent
other information, clients MAY send requests with safe HTTP methods (see
{{!RFC7231}}, Section 4.2.1) in early data when it is available, and SHOULD NOT
send unsafe methods (or methods whose safety is not known) in early data.

If the server rejects early data at the TLS layer, a client MUST start sending
again as though the connection was new. This could entail using a different
negotiated protocol {{?ALPN=RFC7301}} than the one optimistically used for the
early data. Any requests sent in early data MUST be sent again, unless the
client decides to abandon those requests.

This automatic retry exposes the request to a potential replay attack.  An
attacker sends early data to one server instance that accepts and processes the
early data, but allows that connection to proceed no further.  The attacker then
forwards the same messages from the client to another server instance that will
reject early data.  The client then retries the request, resulting in the
request being processed twice.  Replays are also possible if there are multiple
server instances that will accept early data, or if the same server accepts
early data multiple times (though this would be in violation of requirements in
Section 9 of {{!TLS13}}).

Clients that use early data MUST retry requests upon receipt of a 425 (Too
Early) status code; see {{status}}.

An intermediary MUST NOT use early data when forwarding a request unless early
data was used on a previous hop, or it knows that the request can be retried
safely without consequences (typically, using out-of-band configuration).
Absent better information, that means that an intermediary can only use early
data if the request either arrived in early data or arrived with the
`Early-Data` header field set to "1" (see {{header}}).


# Extensions for Early Data in HTTP

Because HTTP requests can span multiple "hops", it is necessary to explicitly
communicate whether a request has been sent in early data on a previous
connection. Likewise, some means of explicitly triggering a retry when early
data is not desirable is necessary. Finally, it is necessary to know whether the
client will actually perform such a retry.

To meet these needs, two signalling mechanisms are defined:

* The `Early-Data` header field is included in requests that might have been
  forwarded by an intermediary prior to the TLS handshake with its client
  completing.

* The 425 (Too Early) status code is defined for a server to indicate that a
  request could not be processed due to the consequences of a possible replay
  attack.

They are designed to enable better coordination of the use of early data
between the user agent and origin server, and also when a gateway (also
"reverse proxy", "Content Delivery Network", or "surrogate") is present.

Gateways typically don't have specific information about whether a given
request can be processed safely when it is sent in early data. In many cases,
only the origin server has the necessary information to decide whether the risk
of replay is acceptable. These extensions allow coordination between a gateway
and its origin server.


## The Early-Data Header Field {#header}

The `Early-Data` request header field indicates that the request has been
conveyed in early data, and additionally indicates that a client understands
the 425 (Too Early) status code.

It has just one valid value: "1". Its syntax is defined by the following ABNF
{{!ABNF=RFC5234}}:

~~~ abnf
Early-Data = "1"
~~~

For example:

~~~ example
GET /resource HTTP/1.0
Host: example.com
Early-Data: 1

~~~

An intermediary that forwards a request prior to the completion of the TLS
handshake with its client MUST send it with the `Early-Data` header field set to
"1" (i.e., it adds it if not present in the request).  An intermediary MUST use
the `Early-Data` header field if it might have forwarded the request prior to
handshake completion (see {{be-consistent}} for details).

An intermediary MUST NOT remove this header field if it is present in a request.

The `Early-Data` header field is not intended for use by user agents (that is,
the original initiator of a request).  Sending a request in early data implies
that the client understands this specification and is willing to retry a request
in response to a 425 (Too Early) status code.  A user agent that sends a request
in early data does not need to include the `Early-Data` header field.

A server cannot make a request that contains the Early-Data header field safe
for processing by waiting for the handshake to complete. A request that is
marked with Early-Data was sent in early data on a previous hop. Requests that
contain the Early-Data field and cannot be safely processed MUST be rejected
using the 425 (Too Early) status code.


## The 425 (Too Early) Status Code {#status}

A 425 (Too Early) status code indicates that the server is unwilling to risk
processing a request that might be replayed.

User agents that send a request in early data MUST automatically retry the
request when receiving a 425 (Too Early) response status code. Such retries MUST
NOT be sent in early data.

In all cases, an intermediary can forward a 425 (Too Early) status code.
Intermediaries MUST forward a 425 (Too Early) status code if the request that it
received and forwarded contained an `Early-Data` header field. Otherwise, an
intermediary that receives a request in early data MAY automatically retry that
request in response to a 425 (Too Early) status code, but it MUST wait for the
TLS handshake to complete on the connection where it received the request.

The server cannot assume that a client is able to retry a request unless the
request is received in early data or the `Early-Data` header field is set to
"1".  A server SHOULD NOT emit the 425 status code unless one of these
conditions is met.

The 425 (Too Early) status code is not cacheable by default. Its payload is not
the representation of any identified resource.


# Security Considerations

Using early data exposes a client to the risk that their request is replayed.  A
retried or replayed request can produce different side effects on the server.
In addition to those side effects, replays and retries might be used for traffic
analysis to recover information about requests or the resources those requests
target.

## Gateways and Early Data

A gateway that forwards requests that were received in early data MUST only do
so if it knows that the origin server that receives those requests understands
the `Early-Data` header field and will correctly generate a 425 (Too Early)
status code.  A gateway that is uncertain about origin server support for a
given request SHOULD either delay forwarding the request until the TLS handshake
with its client completes, or send a 425 (Too Early) status code in response.

A gateway without at least one potential origin server that supports
`Early-Data` header field expends significant effort for what can at best be a
modest performance benefit from enabling early data.  If no origin server
supports early data, disabling early data entirely is more efficient.

## Consistent Handling of Early Data {#be-consistent}

Consistent treatment of a request that arrives in - or partially in - early data
is critical to avoiding inappropriate processing of replayed requests.  If a
request is not safe to process before the TLS handshake completes, then all
instances of the server (including gateways) need to agree and either reject the
request or delay processing.

Disabling early data, delaying requests, or rejecting requests with the 425 (Too
Early) status code are all equally good measures for mitigating replay attacks
on requests that might be vulnerable to replay.  Server instances can implement
any of these measures and be considered to be consistent, even if different
instances use different methods.  Critically, this means that it is possible to
employ different mitigations in reaction to other conditions, such as server
load.

A server MUST NOT act on early data before the handshake completes if it and any
other server instance could make a different decision about how to handle the
same data.

## Denial of Service

Accepting early data exposes a server to potential denial of service through the
replay of requests that are expensive to handle.  A server that is under load
SHOULD prefer rejecting TLS early data as a whole rather than accepting early
data and selectively processing requests.  Generating a 503 (Service
Unavailable) or 425 (Too Early) status code often leads to clients retrying
requests, which could result in increased load.

## Out of Order Delivery

In protocols that deliver data out of order (such as QUIC {{HQ}}) early data can
arrive after the handshake completes.  A server MAY process requests received in
early data after handshake completion if it can rely on other instances
correctly handling replays of the same requests.
