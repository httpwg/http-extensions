--- abstract

TLS provides fundamental mutual authentication services for HTTP, supporting up
to one server certificate and up to one client certificate associated to the
session to prove client and server identities as necessary. This draft provides
mechanisms for providing additional such certificates at the HTTP layer when
these constraints are not sufficient.

Many HTTP servers host content from several origins. HTTP/2 permits clients to
reuse an existing HTTP connection to a server provided that the secondary origin
is also in the certificate provided during the TLS handshake.

In many cases, servers will wish to maintain separate certificates for different
origins but still desire the benefits of a shared HTTP connection. Similarly,
servers may require clients to present authentication, but have different
requirements based on the content the client is attempting to access.

This document describes how TLS exported authenticators can be used to provide
proof of ownership of additional certificates to the HTTP layer to support both
scenarios.

# Introduction

HTTP clients need to know that the content they receive on a connection comes
from the origin that they intended to retrieve in from. The traditional form of
server authentication in HTTP has been in the form of X.509 certificates
provided during the TLS [RFC5246][I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] handshake.

Many existing HTTP [RFC7230] servers also have authentication requirements
for the resources they serve.  Of the bountiful authentication options
available for authenticating HTTP requests, client certificates present a unique
challenge for resource-specific authentication requirements because of the
interaction with the underlying TLS layer.

TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] supports one server and one client certificate on a
connection. These certificates may contain multiple identities, but only one
certificate may be provided.

## Server Certificate Authentication

Section 9.1.1 of [RFC7540] describes how connections may be used to make
requests from multiple origins as long as the server is authoritative
for both. A server is considered authoritative for an origin if DNS
resolves the origin to the IP address of the server and (for TLS) if the
certificate presented by the server contains the origin in the Subject
Alternative Names field.

[RFC7838] enables a step of abstraction from the DNS
resolution. If both hosts have provided an Alternative Service at
hostnames which resolve to the IP address of the server, they are
considered authoritative just as if DNS resolved the origin itself to
that address. However, the server's one TLS certificate is still
required to contain the name of each origin in question.

[I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame] relaxes the requirement to perform the DNS
lookup if already connected to a server with an appropriate certificate which
claims support for a particular origin.

Servers which host many origins often would prefer to have separate
certificates for some sets of origins. This may be for ease of
certificate management (the ability to separately revoke or renew them),
due to different sources of certificates (a CDN acting on behalf of
multiple origins), or other factors which might drive this
administrative decision. Clients connecting to such origins cannot
currently reuse connections, even if both client and server would prefer
to do so.

Because the TLS SNI extension is exchanged in the clear, clients might
also prefer to retrieve certificates inside the encrypted context. When
this information is sensitive, it might be advantageous to request a
general-purpose certificate or anonymous ciphersuite at the TLS layer,
while acquiring the "real" certificate in HTTP after the connection is
established.

## Client Certificate Authentication

For servers that wish to use client certificates to authenticate users,
they might request client authentication during or immediately after the
TLS handshake. However, if not all users or resources need
certificate-based authentication, a request for a certificate has the
unfortunate consequence of triggering the client to seek a certificate,
possibly requiring user interaction, network traffic, or other
time-consuming activities. During this time, the connection is stalled
in many implementations. Such a request can result in a poor experience,
particularly when sent to a client that does not expect the request.

The TLS 1.3 CertificateRequest can be used by servers to give clients
hints about which certificate to offer. Servers that rely on
certificate-based authentication might request different certificates
for different resources. Such a server cannot use contextual information
about the resource to construct an appropriate TLS CertificateRequest
message during the initial handshake.

Consequently, client certificates are requested at connection
establishment time only in cases where all clients are expected or
required to have a single certificate that is used for all resources.
Many other uses for client certificates are reactive, that is,
certificates are requested in response to the client making a request.

### HTTP/1.1 using TLS 1.2 and previous

In HTTP/1.1, a server that relies on client authentication for a subset of users
or resources does not request a certificate when the connection is established.
Instead, it only requests a client certificate when a request is made to a
resource that requires a certificate.  TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] accomodates this
by permitting the server to request a new TLS handshake, in which the server
will request the client's certificate.

{{ex-http11}} shows the server initiating a TLS-layer renegotiation in response
to receiving an HTTP/1.1 request to a protected resource.

~~~
Client                                      Server
   -- (HTTP) GET /protected -------------------> *1
   <---------------------- (TLS) HelloRequest -- *2
   -- (TLS) ClientHello ----------------------->
   <------------------ (TLS) ServerHello, ... --
   <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest -- *3
   -- (TLS) ..., Certificate ------------------> *4
   -- (TLS) Finished -------------------------->
   <-------------------------- (TLS) Finished --
   <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK -- *5
~~~
{: #ex-http11 title="HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.2"}

In this example, the server receives a request for a protected resource (at \*1
on {{ex-http11}}).  Upon performing an authorization check, the server
determines that the request requires authentication using a client certificate
and that no such certificate has been provided.

The server initiates TLS renegotiation by sending a TLS HelloRequest (at \*2).
The client then initiates a TLS handshake.  Note that some TLS messages are
elided from the figure for the sake of brevity.

The critical messages for this example are the server requesting a certificate
with a TLS CertificateRequest (\*3); this request might use information about
the request or resource.  The client then provides a certificate and proof of
possession of the private key in Certificate and CertificateVerify messages
(\*4).

When the handshake completes, the server performs any authorization checks a
second time.  With the client certificate available, it then authorizes the
request and provides a response (\*5).

### HTTP/1.1 using TLS 1.3

TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] introduces a new client authentication mechanism
that allows for clients to authenticate after the handshake has been completed.
For the purposes of authenticating an HTTP request, this is functionally
equivalent to renegotiation.  {{ex-tls13}} shows the simpler exchange this
enables.

~~~
Client                                      Server
   -- (HTTP) GET /protected ------------------->
   <---------------- (TLS) CertificateRequest --
   -- (TLS) Certificate, CertificateVerify,
               Finished ----------------------->
   <--------------------------- (HTTP) 200 OK --
~~~
{: #ex-tls13 title="HTTP/1.1 Reactive Certificate Authentication with TLS 1.3"}

TLS 1.3 does not support renegotiation, instead supporting direct client
authentication.  In contrast to the TLS 1.2 example, in TLS 1.3, a server can
simply request a certificate.

### HTTP/2

An important part of the HTTP/1.1 exchange is that the client is able to easily
identify the request that caused the TLS renegotiation.  The client is able to
assume that the next unanswered request on the connection is responsible.  The
HTTP stack in the client is then able to direct the certificate request to the
application or component that initiated that request.  This ensures that the
application has the right contextual information for processing the request.

In HTTP/2, a client can have multiple outstanding requests.  Without some sort
of correlation information, a client is unable to identify which request caused
the server to request a certificate.

Thus, the minimum necessary mechanism to support reactive certificate
authentication in HTTP/2 is an identifier that can be use to correlate an HTTP
request with a request for a certificate.  Since streams are used for individual
requests, correlation with a stream is sufficient.

[RFC7540] prohibits renegotiation after any application data has been sent.
This completely blocks reactive certificate authentication in HTTP/2 using TLS
1.2. If this restriction were relaxed by an extension or update to HTTP/2, such
an identifier could be added to TLS 1.2 by means of an extension to TLS.
Unfortunately, many TLS 1.2 implementations do not permit application data to
continue during a renegotiation. This is problematic for a multiplexed protocol
like HTTP/2.

## HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication

This draft defines HTTP/2 frames to carry the relevant certificate messages,
enabling certificate-based authentication of both clients and servers
independent of TLS version. This mechanism can be implemented at the HTTP layer
without breaking the existing interface between HTTP and applications above it.

This could be done in a naive manner by replicating the TLS messages as HTTP/2
frames on each stream. However, this would create needless redundancy between
streams and require frequent expensive signing operations. Instead, TLS Exported
Authenticators [I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator] are exchanged on
stream zero and the on-stream frames incorporate them by reference as needed.

TLS Exported Authenticators are structured messages that can be exported by
either party of a TLS connection and validated by the other party. An
authenticator message can be constructed by either the client or the server
given an established TLS connection, a certificate, and a corresponding private
key.  Exported Authenticators use the message structures from section 4.4 of
[I-D.ietf-tls-tls13], but different parameters.

Each Authenticator is computed using a Handshake Context and Finished MAC Key
derived from the TLS session.  The Handshake Context is identical for both
parties of the TLS connection, while the Finished MAC Key is dependent on
whether the Authenticator is created by the client or the server.

Successfully verified Authenticators result in certificate chains, with verified
possession of the corresponding private key, which can be supplied into a
collection of available certificates. Likewise, descriptions of desired
certificates can be supplied into these collections. These pre-supplied elements
are then available for automatic use (in some situations) or for reference by
individual streams.

{{discovery}} describes how the feature is employed, defining means to detect
support in peers ({{setting}}), make certificates and requests available
({{cert-available}}), and indicate when streams are blocked waiting on an
appropriate certificate ({{cert-challenge}}). {{certs-http2}} defines the
required frame types, which parallel the TLS 1.3 message exchange. Finally,
{{errors}} defines new error types which can be used to notify peers when the
exchange has not been successful.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}}
when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


# Discovering Additional Certificates at the HTTP/2 Layer {#discovery}

A certificate chain with proof of possession of the private key corresponding to
the end-entity certificate is sent as a single `CERTIFICATE` frame (see
{{http-cert}}) on stream zero. Once the holder of a certificate has sent the
chain and proof, this certificate chain is cached by the recipient and available
for future use. If the certificate is marked as `AUTOMATIC_USE`, the certificate
may be used by the recipient to authorize any current or future request.
Otherwise, the recipient requests the required certificate on each stream, but
the previously-supplied certificates are available for reference without having
to resend them.

Likewise, the details of a request are sent on stream zero and stored by
the recipient. These details will be referenced by subsequent
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames.

Data sent by each peer is correlated by the ID given in each frame.  This
ID is unrelated to values used by the other peer, even if each uses the
same ID in certain cases.

## Indicating support for HTTP-layer certificate authentication {#setting}

Clients and servers that will accept requests for HTTP-layer certificate
authentication indicate this using the HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH`
(0xSETTING-TBD) setting.

The initial value for the `SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH` setting is 0,
indicating that the peer does not support HTTP-layer certificate authentication.
If a peer does support HTTP-layer certificate authentication, the value
is 1.

## Making certificates or requests available {#cert-available}

When a peer has advertised support for HTTP-layer certificates as in
{{setting}}, either party can supply additional certificates into the
connection at any time. These certificates then become available for the
peer to consider when deciding whether a connection is suitable to
transport a particular request.

Available certificates which have the `AUTOMATIC_USE` flag set MAY be
used by the recipient without further notice. This means that clients or
servers which predict a certificate will be required could pre-supply
the certificate without being asked. Regardless of whether
`AUTOMATIC_USE` is set, these certificates are available for reference
by future `USE_CERTIFICATE` frames.

~~~
Client                                      Server
   <-------- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE (AU flag) --
   ...
   -- (stream N) GET /from-new-origin --------->
   <----------------------- (stream N) 200 OK --

~~~
{: #ex-http2-server-proactive title="Proactive Server Certificate"}

~~~
Client                                      Server
   -- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE (AU flag) -------->
   -- (streams 1,3) GET /protected ------------>
   <-------------------- (streams 1,3) 200 OK --

~~~
{: #ex-http2-client-proactive title="Proactive Client Certificate"}

Likewise, either party can supply a `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` that outlines
parameters of a certificate they might request in the future.  It
is important to note that this does not currently request such a
certificate, but makes the contents of the request available for
reference by a future `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame.

## Requiring certificate authentication {#cert-challenge}

As defined in [RFC7540], when a client finds that a https:// origin (or
Alternative Service [RFC7838]) to which it needs to
make a request has the same IP address as a server to which it is
already connected, it MAY check whether the TLS certificate provided
contains the new origin as well, and if so, reuse the connection.

If the TLS certificate does not contain the new origin, but the server has
claimed support for that origin (with an ORIGIN frame, see
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame]) and advertised support for HTTP-layer
certificates (see {{setting}}), it MAY send a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame on the
stream it will use to make the request. (If the request parameters have not
already been made available using a `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame, the client will
need to send the `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` in order to generate the
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame.) The stream represents a pending request to that
origin which is blocked until a valid certificate is processed.

The request is blocked until the server has responded with a
`USE_CERTIFICATE` frame pointing to a certificate for that origin. If
the certificate is already available, the server SHOULD immediately
respond with the appropriate `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame. (If the
certificate has not already been transmitted, the server will need to
make the certificate available as described in {{cert-available}} before
completing the exchange.)

If the server does not have the desired certificate, it MUST respond with an
empty `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame. In this case, or if the server has not advertised
support for HTTP-layer certificates, the client MUST NOT send any requests for
resources in that origin on the current connection.

~~~
Client                                      Server
   <----------------------- (stream 0) ORIGIN --
   -- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE_REQUEST ---------->
   ...
   -- (stream N) CERTIFICATE_NEEDED ----------->
   <------------------ (stream 0) CERTIFICATE --
   <-------------- (stream N) USE_CERTIFICATE --
   -- (stream N) GET /from-new-origin --------->
   <----------------------- (stream N) 200 OK --

~~~
{: #ex-http2-server-requested title="Client-Requested Certificate"}

Likewise, on each stream where certificate authentication is required,
the server sends a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame, which the client
answers with a `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame indicating the certificate to
use. If the request parameters or the responding certificate are not
already available, they will need to be sent as described in
{{cert-available}} as part of this exchange.

~~~
Client                                      Server
   <---------- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE_REQUEST --
   ...
   -- (stream N) GET /protected --------------->
   <----------- (stream N) CERTIFICATE_NEEDED --
   -- (stream 0) CERTIFICATE ------------------>
   -- (stream N) USE_CERTIFICATE -------------->
   <----------------------- (stream N) 200 OK --

~~~
{: #ex-http2-client-requested title="Reactive Certificate Authentication"}

A server SHOULD provide certificates for an origin before pushing resources from
it or supplying content referencing the origin. If a client receives a
`PUSH_PROMISE` referencing an origin for which it has not yet received the
server's certificate, the client MUST verify the server's possession of an
appropriate certificate by sending a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame on the pushed
stream to inform the server that progress is blocked until the request is
satisfied. The client MUST NOT use the pushed resource until an appropriate
certificate has been received and validated.

# Certificates Frames for HTTP/2 {#certs-http2}

The `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` and `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames are
correlated by their `Request-ID` field. Subsequent
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames with the same `Request-ID` value MAY be
sent on other streams where the sender is expecting a certificate with
the same parameters.

The `CERTIFICATE`, and `USE_CERTIFICATE` frames are correlated by their
`Cert-ID` field. Subsequent `USE_CERTIFICATE` frames with the same `Cert-ID` MAY
be sent in response to other `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames and refer to the same
certificate.

`Request-ID` and `Cert-ID` are sender-local, and the use of the same value by
the other peer does not imply any correlation between their frames. These values
MUST be unique per sender over the lifetime of the connection.

## The CERTIFICATE_NEEDED frame {#http-cert-needed}

The `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame (0xFRAME-TBD1) is sent to indicate that
the HTTP request on the current stream is blocked pending certificate
authentication. The frame includes a request identifier which can be
used to correlate the stream with a previous `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame
sent on stream zero. The `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` describes the certificate
the sender requires to make progress on the stream in question.

The `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame contains 2 octets, which is the
authentication request identifier, `Request-ID`. A peer that receives a
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` of any other length MUST treat this as a stream
error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`. Frames with identical request
identifiers refer to the same `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST`.

A server MAY send multiple `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames on the same
stream. If a server requires that a client provide multiple certificates
before authorizing a single request, each required certificate MUST be
indicated with a separate `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame, each of which
MUST have a different request identifier (referencing different
`CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frames describing each required certificate). To
reduce the risk of client confusion, servers SHOULD NOT have multiple
outstanding `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames on the same stream at any
given time.

Clients MUST NOT send multiple `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames
on the same stream.

The `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame MUST NOT be sent to a peer which has
not advertised support for HTTP-layer certificate authentication.

The `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame MUST NOT be sent on stream zero, and MUST
NOT be sent on a stream in the "half-closed (local)" state [RFC7540]. A
client that receives a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame on a stream which is
not in a valid state SHOULD treat this as a stream error of type
`PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

## The USE_CERTIFICATE Frame {#http-use-certificate}

The `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame (0xFRAME-TBD4) is sent in response to a
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame to indicate which certificate is being used
to satisfy the requirement.

A `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame with no payload refers to the certificate
provided at the TLS layer, if any. If no certificate was provided at the
TLS layer, the stream should be processed with no authentication, likely
returning an authentication-related error at the HTTP level (e.g. 403)
for servers or routing the request to a new connection for clients.

Otherwise, the `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame contains the two-octet `Cert-ID` of the
certificate the sender wishes to use. This MUST be the ID of a certificate for
which proof of possession has been presented in a `CERTIFICATE` frame.
Recipients of a `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame of any other length MUST treat this as a
stream error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`. Frames with identical certificate
identifiers refer to the same certificate chain.

The `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame MUST NOT be sent on stream zero or a stream on which
a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame has not been received. Receipt of a
`USE_CERTIFICATE` frame in these circumstances SHOULD be treated as a stream
error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`. Each `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame should reference a
preceding `CERTIFICATE` frame. Receipt of a `USE_CERTIFICATE` frame before the
necessary frames have been received on stream zero MUST also result in a stream
error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

The referenced certificate chain MUST conform to the requirements expressed in
the `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` to the best of the sender's ability. Specifically, if
the `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` contained a non-empty `Cert-Extensions` element, the
end-entity certificate MUST match with regard to the extensions recognized by
the sender.

If these requirements are not satisfied, the recipient MAY at its discretion
either return an error at the HTTP semantic layer, or respond with a stream
error {{RFC7540}} on any stream where the certificate is used. {{errors}}
defines certificate-related error codes which might be applicable.

## The CERTIFICATE_REQUEST Frame {#http-cert-request}

TLS 1.3 defines the `CertificateRequest` message, which prompts the client to
provide a certificate which conforms to certain properties specified by the
server.  This draft defines the `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame (0xFRAME-TBD2),
which uses the same set of extensions to specify a desired certificate, but
can be sent over any TLS version and can be sent by either peer.

The `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame SHOULD NOT be sent to a peer which has not
advertised support for HTTP-layer certificate authentication.

The `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A
`CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame received on any other stream MUST be rejected with a
stream error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-cert-request title="CERTIFICATE_REQUEST frame payload"}

The frame contains the following fields:

Request-ID:
: `Request-ID` is a 16-bit opaque identifier used to correlate subsequent
  certificate-related frames with this request.  The identifier MUST be unique
  in the session for the sender.

Extension-Count and Extensions:
: A list of certificate selection criteria, represented in a series of
  `Extension` structures (see [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] section 4.2). This criteria
  MUST be used in certificate selection as described in {{I-D.ietf-tls-tls13}}.
  The number of `Extension` structures is given by the 16-bit `Extension-Count`
  field, which MAY be zero.

Some extensions used for certificate selection allow multiple values (e.g.
oid_filters on Extended Key Usage). If the sender has included a non-empty
Extensions list, the certificate MUST match all criteria specified by extensions
the recipient recognizes. However, the recipient MUST ignore and skip any
unrecognized certificate selection extensions.

Servers MUST be able to recognize the `server_name` extension ([RFC6066]) at a
minimum. Clients MUST always specify the desired origin using this extension,
though other extensions MAY also be included.

## The CERTIFICATE Frame {#http-cert}

The `CERTIFICATE` frame (id=0xFRAME-TBD3) provides a exported authenticator
message from the TLS layer that provides a chain of certificates, associated
extensions and proves possession of the private key corresponding to the
end-entity certificate.

The `CERTIFICATE` frame defines two flags:

AUTOMATIC_USE (0x01):
: Indicates that the certificate can be used automatically on future
  requests.

TO_BE_CONTINUED (0x02):
: Indicates that the exported authenticator spans more than one frame.

~~~~~~~~~~~~
  0                   1                   2                   3
  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
 +-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
 |          Cert-ID (16)         |   Authenticator Fragment (*)...
 +---------------------------------------------------------------+
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
{: #fig-proof-frame title="CERTIFICATE frame payload"}

The `Exported Authenticator Fragment` field contains a portion of the opaque
data returned from the TLS connection exported authenticator `authenticate` API.
See {{exp-auth}} for more details on the input to this API.

This opaque data is transported in zero or more `CERTIFICATE` frames with the
`TO_BE_CONTINUED` flag set, followed by one `CERTIFICATE` frame with the
`TO_BE_CONTINUED` flag unset.  Each of these frames contains the same `Cert-ID`
field, permitting them to be associated with each other.  Receipt of any
`CERTIFICATE` frame with the same `Cert-ID` following the receipt of a
`CERTIFICATE` frame with `TO_BE_CONTINUED` unset MUST be treated as a connection
error of type `PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

If the `AUTOMATIC_USE` flag is set, the recipient MAY omit sending
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frames on future streams which would require a
similar certificate and use the referenced certificate for
authentication without further notice to the holder. This behavior is
optional, and receipt of a `CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` frame does not imply
that previously-presented certificates were unacceptable, even if
`AUTOMATIC_USE` was set. Servers MUST set the `AUTOMATIC_USE` flag when
sending a `CERTIFICATE` frame. A server MUST NOT send certificates
for origins which it is not prepared to service on the current
connection.

Upon receiving a complete series of `CERTIFICATE` frames, the receiver may
validate the Exported Authenticator value by using the exported authenticator
API. This returns either an error indicating that the message was invalid, or
the certificate chain and extensions used to create the message.

The `CERTIFICATE` frame MUST be sent on stream zero.  A `CERTIFICATE` frame
received on any other stream MUST be rejected with a stream error of type
`PROTOCOL_ERROR`.

### Exported Authenticator Characteristics {#exp-auth}

The Exported Authenticator API defined in [I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator]
takes as input a certificate, supporting information about the certificate
(OCSP, SCT, etc.), and an optional `certificate_request_context`.  When
generating exported authenticators for use with this extension, the
`certificate_request_context` MUST be the two-octet Cert-ID.

Upon receipt of a completed authenticator, an endpoint MUST check that:

 - the `validate` API confirms the validity of the authenticator itself
 - the `certificate_request_context` matches the Cert-ID of the frame(s) in
   which it was received

Once the authenticator is accepted, the endpoint can perform any other checks
for the acceptability of the certificate itself.

# Indicating failures during HTTP-Layer Certificate Authentication {#errors}

Because this draft permits certificates to be exchanged at the HTTP
framing layer instead of the TLS layer, several certificate-related
errors which are defined at the TLS layer might now occur at the HTTP
framing layer. In this section, those errors are restated and added to
the HTTP/2 error code registry.

BAD_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD1):
:  A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures that did not verify
   correctly, etc.

UNSUPPORTED_CERTIFICATE (0xERROR-TBD2):
: A certificate was of an unsupported type or did not contain required
  extensions

CERTIFICATE_REVOKED (0xERROR-TBD3):
:  A certificate was revoked by its signer

CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED (0xERROR-TBD4):
:  A certificate has expired or is not currently valid

CERTIFICATE_GENERAL (0xERROR-TBD5):
:  Any other certificate-related error

As described in [RFC7540], implementations MAY choose to treat a stream error as
a connection error at any time. Of particular note, a stream error cannot occur
on stream 0, which means that implementations cannot send non-session errors in
response to `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST`, and `CERTIFICATE` frames. Implementations
which do not wish to terminate the connection MAY either send relevant errors on
any stream which references the failing certificate in question or process the
requests as unauthenticated and provide error information at the HTTP semantic
layer.

# Security Considerations {#security}

This mechanism defines an alternate way to obtain server and client certificates
other than in the initial TLS handshake. While the signature of exported
authenticator values is expected to be equally secure, it is important to
recognize that a vulnerability in this code path is at least equal to a
vulnerability in the TLS handshake.

## Impersonation

This mechanism could increase the impact of a key compromise. Rather than
needing to subvert DNS or IP routing in order to use a compromised certificate,
a malicious server now only needs a client to connect to *some* HTTPS site under
its control in order to present the compromised certificate. As recommended in
[I-D.ietf-httpbis-origin-frame], clients opting not to consult DNS ought to
employ some alternative means to increase confidence that the certificate is
legitimate.

As noted in the Security Considerations of
[I-D.ietf-tls-exported-authenticator], it difficult to formally prove that an
endpoint is jointly authoritative over multiple certificates, rather than
individually authoritative on each certificate.  As a result, clients MUST NOT
assume that because one origin was previously colocated with another, those
origins will be reachable via the same endpoints in the future.  Clients MUST
NOT consider previous secondary certificates to be validated after TLS session
resumption.  However, clients MAY proactively query for previously-presented
secondary certificates.

## Fingerprinting

This draft defines a mechanism which could be used to probe servers for
origins they support, but opens no new attack versus making repeat TLS
connections with different SNI values. Servers SHOULD impose similar
denial-of-service mitigations (e.g. request rate limits) to
`CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frames as to new TLS connections.

While the extensions in the `CERTIFICATE_REQUEST` frame permit the sender to
enumerate the acceptable Certificate Authorities for the requested certificate,
it might not be prudent (either for security or data consumption) to include the
full list of trusted Certificate Authorities in every request. Senders,
particularly clients, SHOULD send only the extensions that narrowly specify
which certificates would be acceptable.

## Denial of Service

Failure to provide a certificate on a stream after receiving
`CERTIFICATE_NEEDED` blocks processing, and SHOULD be subject to standard
timeouts used to guard against unresponsive peers.

Validating a multitude of signatures can be computationally expensive, while
generating an invalid signature is computationally cheap. Implementations will
require checks for attacks from this direction. Invalid exported authenticators
SHOULD be treated as a session error, to avoid further attacks from the peer,
though an implementation MAY instead disable HTTP-layer certificates for the
current connection instead.

## Confusion About State

Implementations need to be aware of the potential for confusion about
the state of a connection. The presence or absence of a validated
certificate can change during the processing of a request, potentially
multiple times, as `USE_CERTIFICATE` frames are received. A server that
uses certificate authentication needs to be prepared to reevaluate the
authorization state of a request as the set of certificates changes.

Client implementations need to carefully consider the impact of setting
the `AUTOMATIC_USE` flag. This flag is a performance optimization,
permitting the client to avoid a round-trip on each request where the
server checks for certificate authentication. However, once this flag
has been sent, the client has zero knowledge about whether the server
will use the referenced cert for any future request, or even for an
existing request which has not yet completed. Clients MUST NOT set this
flag on any certificate which is not appropriate for currently-in-flight
requests, and MUST NOT make any future requests on the same connection
which they are not willing to have associated with the provided
certificate.

# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This draft adds entries in three registries.

The HTTP/2 `SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH` setting is registered in {{iana-setting}}.
Four frame types are registered in {{iana-frame}}.  Six error codes are
registered in {{iana-errors}}.

## HTTP/2 SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH Setting {#iana-setting}

The SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH setting is registered in the "HTTP/2 Settings"
registry established in [RFC7540].

Name:
: SETTINGS_HTTP_CERT_AUTH

Code:
: 0xSETTING-TBD

Initial Value:
: 0

Specification:
: This document.

## New HTTP/2 Frames {#iana-frame}

Four new frame types are registered in the "HTTP/2 Frame Types" registry
established in [RFC7540]. The entries in the following table are
registered by this document.

|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Frame Type          | Code         | Specification           |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| CERTIFICATE_NEEDED  | 0xFRAME-TBD1 | {{http-cert-needed}}    |
| CERTIFICATE_REQUEST | 0xFRAME-TBD2 | {{http-cert-request}}   |
| CERTIFICATE         | 0xFRAME-TBD3 | {{http-cert}}           |
| USE_CERTIFICATE     | 0xFRAME-TBD4 | {{http-use-certificate}}|
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------------|

## New HTTP/2 Error Codes {#iana-errors}

Five new error codes are registered in the "HTTP/2 Error Code" registry
established in [RFC7540]. The entries in the following table are
registered by this document.

|-------------------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Name                    | Code         | Specification           |
