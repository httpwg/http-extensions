--- abstract

This document describes a set of data types and associated algorithms that are intended to make it easier and safer to define and handle HTTP header and trailer fields, known as "Structured Fields", "Structured Headers", or "Structured Trailers". It is intended for use by specifications of new HTTP fields that wish to use a common syntax that is more restrictive than traditional HTTP field values.

This document obsoletes RFC 8941.

# Introduction

Specifying the syntax of new HTTP header (and trailer) fields is an onerous task; even with the guidance in {{Section 16.3.2 of HTTP}}, there are many decisions -- and pitfalls -- for a prospective HTTP field author.

Once a field is defined, bespoke parsers and serializers often need to be written, because each field value has a slightly different handling of what looks like common syntax.

This document introduces a set of common data structures for use in definitions of new HTTP field values to address these problems. In particular, it defines a generic, abstract model for them, along with a concrete serialization for expressing that model in HTTP {{HTTP}} header and trailer fields.

An HTTP field that is defined as a "Structured Header" or "Structured Trailer" (if the field can be either, it is a "Structured Field") uses the types defined in this specification to define its syntax and basic handling rules, thereby simplifying both its definition by specification writers and handling by implementations.

Additionally, future versions of HTTP can define alternative serializations of the abstract model of these structures, allowing fields that use that model to be transmitted more efficiently without being redefined.

Note that it is not a goal of this document to redefine the syntax of existing HTTP fields; the mechanisms described herein are only intended to be used with fields that explicitly opt into them.

{{specify}} describes how to specify a Structured Field.

{{types}} defines a number of abstract data types that can be used in Structured Fields.

Those abstract types can be serialized into and parsed from HTTP field values using the algorithms described in {{text}}.


## Intentionally Strict Processing {#strict}

This specification intentionally defines strict parsing and serialization behaviors using step-by-step algorithms; the only error handling defined is to fail the entire operation altogether.

It is designed to encourage faithful implementation and good interoperability. Therefore, an implementation that tried to be helpful by being more tolerant of input would make interoperability worse, since that would create pressure on other implementations to implement similar (but likely subtly different) workarounds.

In other words, strict processing is an intentional feature of this specification; it allows non-conformant input to be discovered and corrected by the producer early and avoids both interoperability and security issues that might otherwise result.

Note that as a result of this strictness, if a field is appended to by multiple parties (e.g., intermediaries or different components in the sender), an error in one party's value is likely to cause the entire field value to fail parsing.


## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

This document uses the VCHAR, SP, DIGIT, ALPHA, and DQUOTE rules from {{?RFC5234}} to specify characters and/or their corresponding ASCII bytes, depending on context. It uses the tchar and OWS rules from {{HTTP}} for the same purpose.

This document uses algorithms to specify parsing and serialization behaviors. When parsing from HTTP fields, implementations MUST have behavior that is indistinguishable from following the algorithms.

For serialization to HTTP fields, the algorithms define the recommended way to produce them. Implementations MAY vary from the specified behavior so long as the output is still correctly handled by the parsing algorithm described in {{text-parse}}.


# Defining New Structured Fields {#specify}

To specify an HTTP field as a Structured Field, its authors need to:

* Normatively reference this specification. Recipients and generators of the field need to know that the requirements of this document are in effect.

* Identify whether the field is a Structured Header (i.e., it can only be used in the header section -- the common case), a Structured Trailer (only in the trailer section), or a Structured Field (both).

* Specify the type of the field value; either List ({{list}}), Dictionary ({{dictionary}}), or Item ({{item}}).

* Define the semantics of the field value.

* Specify any additional constraints upon the field value, as well as the consequences when those constraints are violated.

Typically, this means that a field definition will specify the top-level type -- List, Dictionary, or Item -- and then define its allowable types and constraints upon them. For example, a header defined as a List might have all Integer members, or a mix of types; a header defined as an Item might allow only Strings, and additionally only strings beginning with the letter "Q", or strings in lowercase. Likewise, Inner Lists ({{inner-list}}) are only valid when a field definition explicitly allows them.

Field definitions can only use this specification for the entire field value, not a portion thereof.

Specifications can refer to a field name as a "structured header name", "structured trailer name", or "structured field name" as appropriate. Likewise, they can refer its field value as a "structured header value", "structured trailer value", or "structured field value" as necessary.

This specification defines minimums for the length or number of various structures supported by implementations. It does not specify maximum sizes in most cases, but authors should be aware that HTTP implementations do impose various limits on the size of individual fields, the total number of fields, and/or the size of the entire header or trailer section.

## Example

A fictitious Foo-Example header field might be specified as:

<blockquote>
<t>42. Foo-Example Header Field</t>

<t>The Foo-Example HTTP header field conveys information about how
much Foo the message has.</t>

<t>Foo-Example is an Item Structured Header Field [RFCnnnn]. Its value
MUST be an Integer (Section 3.3.1 of [RFCnnnn]).</t>

<t>Its value indicates the amount of Foo in the message, and it MUST
be between 0 and 10, inclusive; other values MUST cause
the entire header field to be ignored.</t>

<t>The following parameter is defined:</t>

<ul>
<li>A parameter whose key is "foourl", and whose value is a String
  (Section 3.3.3 of [RFCnnnn]), conveying the Foo URL
  for the message. See below for processing requirements.</li>
</ul>

<t>"foourl" contains a URI-reference (Section 4.1 of [RFC3986]). If
its value is not a valid URI-reference, the entire header field
MUST be ignored. If its value is a relative reference (Section 4.2
of [RFC3986]), it MUST be resolved (Section 5 of [RFC3986]) before
being used.</t>

<t>For example:</t>

<artwork>
  Foo-Example: 2; foourl="https://foo.example.com/"
</artwork>
</blockquote>

## Error Handling

When parsing fails, the entire field is ignored (see {{text-parse}}). Field definitions cannot override this, because doing so would preclude handling by generic software; they can only add additional constraints (for example, on the numeric range of Integers and Decimals, the format of Strings and Tokens, the types allowed in a Dictionary's values, or the number of Items in a List).

When field-specific constraints are violated, the entire field is also ignored, unless the field definition defines other handling requirements. For example, if a header field is defined as an Item and required to be an Integer, but a String is received, it should be ignored unless that field's definition explicitly specifies otherwise.


## Preserving Extensibility

Structured Fields are designed to be extensible, because experience has shown that even when it is not foreseen, it is often necessary to modify and add to the allowable syntax and semantics of a field in a controlled fashion.

Both Items and Inner Lists allow Parameters as an extensibility mechanism; this means that their values can later be extended to accommodate more information, if need be. To preserve forward compatibility, field specifications are discouraged from defining the presence of an unrecognized parameter as an error condition.

Field specifications are required to be either an Item, List, or Dictionary to preserve extensibility. Fields that erroneously defined as another type (e.g., Integer) are assumed to be Items (i.e., they allow Parameters).

To further assure that this extensibility is available in the future, and to encourage consumers to use a complete parser implementation, a field definition can specify that "grease" parameters be added by senders. A specification could stipulate that all parameters that fit a defined pattern are reserved for this use and then encourage them to be sent on some portion of requests. This helps to discourage recipients from writing a parser that does not account for Parameters.

Specifications that use Dictionaries can also allow for forward compatibility by requiring that the presence of -- as well as value and type associated with -- unknown keys be ignored. Subsequent specifications can then add additional keys, specifying constraints on them as appropriate.

An extension to a Structured Field can then require that an entire field value be ignored by a recipient that understands the extension if constraints on the value it defines are not met.

## Using New Structured Types in Extensions

Because a field definition needs to reference a specific RFC for Structured Fields, the types available for use in its value are limited to those defined in that RFC. For example, a field whose definition references this document can have a value that uses the Date type ({{date}}), whereas a field whose definition references RFC 8941 cannot, because it will be treated as invalid (and therefore discarded) by implementations of that specification.

This limitation also applies to future extensions to a field; for example, a field that is defined with reference to RFC 8941 cannot use the Date type, because some recipients might still be using an RFC 8941 parser to process it.

However, this document is designed to be backwards-compatible with RFC 8941; a parser that implements the requirements here can also parse valid Structured Fields whose definitions reference RFC 8941.

Upgrading a Structured Fields implementation to support a newer revision of the specification (such as this document) brings the possibility that some field values that were invalid according to the earlier RFC might become valid when processed.

For example, field instance might contain a syntactically valid Date ({{date}}), even though that field's definition does not accommodate Dates. An RFC8941 implementation would fail parsing such a field instance, because they are not defined in that specification. If that implementation were upgraded to this specification, parsing would now succeed. In some cases, the resulting Date value will be rejected by field-specific logic, but values in fields that are otherwise ignored (such as extension parameters) might not be detected and the field might subsequently be accepted and processed.


# Structured Data Types {#types}

This section defines the abstract types for Structured Fields, and summarizes how those types are serialized into textual HTTP fields.

In summary:

* There are three top-level types that an HTTP field can be defined as: Lists, Dictionaries, and Items.

* Lists and Dictionaries are containers; their members can be Items or Inner Lists (which are themselves arrays of Items).

* Both Items and Inner Lists can be Parameterized with key/value pairs.


## Lists {#list}

Lists are arrays of zero or more members, each of which can be an Item ({{item}}) or an Inner List ({{inner-list}}), both of which can be Parameterized ({{param}}).

An empty List is denoted by not serializing the field at all. This implies that fields defined as Lists have a default empty value.

When serialized as a textual HTTP field, each member is separated by a comma and optional whitespace. For example, a field whose value is defined as a List of Tokens could look like:

~~~ http-message
Example-List: sugar, tea, rum
~~~

Note that Lists can have their members split across multiple lines of the same header or trailer section, as per {{Section 5.3 of HTTP}}; for example, the following are equivalent:

~~~ http-message
Example-List: sugar, tea, rum
~~~

and

~~~ http-message
Example-List: sugar, tea
Example-List: rum
~~~

However, individual members of a List cannot be safely split between lines; see {{text-parse}} for details.

Parsers MUST support Lists containing at least 1024 members. Field specifications can constrain the types and cardinality of individual List values as they require.


### Inner Lists {#inner-list}

An Inner List is an array of zero or more Items ({{item}}). Both the individual Items and the Inner List itself can be Parameterized ({{param}}).

When serialized in a textual HTTP field, Inner Lists are denoted by surrounding parenthesis, and their values are delimited by one or more spaces. A field whose value is defined as a List of Inner Lists of Strings could look like:

~~~ http-message
Example-List: ("foo" "bar"), ("baz"), ("bat" "one"), ()
~~~

Note that the last member in this example is an empty Inner List.

A header field whose value is defined as a List of Inner Lists with Parameters at both levels could look like:

~~~ http-message
Example-List: ("foo"; a=1;b=2);lvl=5, ("bar" "baz");lvl=1
~~~

Parsers MUST support Inner Lists containing at least 256 members. Field specifications can constrain the types and cardinality of individual Inner List members as they require.


### Parameters {#param}

Parameters are an ordered map of key-value pairs that are associated with an Item ({{item}}) or Inner List ({{inner-list}}). The keys are unique within the scope of the Parameters they occur within, and the values are bare items (i.e., they themselves cannot be parameterized; see {{item}}).

Implementations MUST provide access to Parameters both by index and by key. Specifications MAY use either means of accessing them.

Note that parameters are ordered, and parameter keys cannot contain uppercase letters.

When serialized in a textual HTTP field, a Parameter is separated from its Item or Inner List and other Parameters by a semicolon. For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-List: abc;a=1;b=2; cde_456, (ghi;jk=4 l);q="9";r=w
~~~

Parameters whose value is Boolean (see {{boolean}}) true MUST omit that value when serialized. For example, the "a" parameter here is true, while the "b" parameter is false:

~~~ http-message
Example-Integer: 1; a; b=?0
~~~

Note that this requirement is only on serialization; parsers are still required to correctly handle the true value when it appears in a parameter.

Parsers MUST support at least 256 parameters on an Item or Inner List, and support parameter keys with at least 64 characters. Field specifications can constrain the order of individual parameters, as well as their values' types as required.


## Dictionaries {#dictionary}

Dictionaries are ordered maps of key-value pairs, where the keys are short textual strings and the values are Items ({{item}}) or arrays of Items, both of which can be Parameterized ({{param}}). There can be zero or more members, and their keys are unique in the scope of the Dictionary they occur within.

Implementations MUST provide access to Dictionaries both by index and by key. Specifications MAY use either means of accessing the members.

As with Lists, an empty Dictionary is represented by omitting the entire field. This implies that fields defined as Dictionaries have a default empty value.

Typically, a field specification will define the semantics of Dictionaries by specifying the allowed type(s) for individual members by their keys, as well as whether their presence is required or optional. Recipients MUST ignore members whose keys are undefined or unknown, unless the field's specification specifically disallows them.

When serialized as a textual HTTP field, Members are ordered as serialized and separated by a comma with optional whitespace. Member keys cannot contain uppercase characters. Keys and values are separated by "=" (without whitespace). For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: en="Applepie", da=:w4ZibGV0w6ZydGU=:
~~~

Note that in this example, the final "=" is due to the inclusion of a Byte Sequence; see {{binary}}.

Members whose value is Boolean (see {{boolean}}) true MUST omit that value when serialized. For example, here both "b" and "c" are true:

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: a=?0, b, c; foo=bar
~~~

Note that this requirement is only on serialization; parsers are still required to correctly handle the true Boolean value when it appears in Dictionary values.

A Dictionary with a member whose value is an Inner List of Tokens:

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: rating=1.5, feelings=(joy sadness)
~~~

A Dictionary with a mix of Items and Inner Lists, some with parameters:

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: a=(1 2), b=3, c=4;aa=bb, d=(5 6);valid
~~~

Note that Dictionaries can have their members split across multiple lines of the same header or trailer section; for example, the following are equivalent:

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: foo=1, bar=2
~~~

and

~~~ http-message
Example-Dict: foo=1
Example-Dict: bar=2
~~~

However, individual members of a Dictionary cannot be safely split between lines; see {{text-parse}} for details.

Parsers MUST support Dictionaries containing at least 1024 key/value pairs and keys with at least 64 characters. Field specifications can constrain the order of individual Dictionary members, as well as their values' types as required.


## Items {#item}

An Item can be an Integer ({{integer}}), a Decimal ({{decimal}}), a String ({{string}}), a Token ({{token}}), a Byte Sequence ({{binary}}), a Boolean ({{boolean}}), or a Date ({{date}}). It can have associated parameters ({{param}}).

For example, a header field that is defined to be an Item that is an Integer might look like:

~~~ http-message
Example-Integer: 5
~~~

or with parameters:

~~~ http-message
Example-Integer: 5; foo=bar
~~~


### Integers {#integer}

Integers have a range of -999,999,999,999,999 to 999,999,999,999,999 inclusive (i.e., up to fifteen digits, signed), for IEEE 754 compatibility {{IEEE754}}.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-Integer: 42
~~~

Integers larger than 15 digits can be supported in a variety of ways; for example, by using a String ({{string}}), a Byte Sequence ({{binary}}), or a parameter on an Integer that acts as a scaling factor.

While it is possible to serialize Integers with leading zeros (e.g., "0002", "-01") and signed zero ("-0"), these distinctions may not be preserved by implementations.

Note that commas in Integers are used in this section's prose only for readability; they are not valid in the wire format.


### Decimals {#decimal}

Decimals are numbers with an integer and a fractional component. The integer component has at most 12 digits; the fractional component has at most three digits.

For example, a header whose value is defined as a Decimal could look like:

~~~ http-message
Example-Decimal: 4.5
~~~

While it is possible to serialize Decimals with leading zeros (e.g., "0002.5", "-01.334"), trailing zeros (e.g., "5.230", "-0.40"), and signed zero (e.g., "-0.0"), these distinctions may not be preserved by implementations.

Note that the serialization algorithm ({{ser-decimal}}) rounds input with more than three digits of precision in the fractional component. If an alternative rounding strategy is desired, this should be specified by the field definition to occur before serialization.


### Strings {#string}

Strings are zero or more printable ASCII {{!RFC0020}} characters (i.e., the range %x20 to %x7E). Note that this excludes tabs, newlines, carriage returns, etc.

Non-ASCII characters are not directly supported in Strings, because they cause a number of interoperability issues, and -- with few exceptions -- field values do not require them.

When it is necessary for a field value to convey non-ASCII content, a Display String ({{displaystring}}) can be specified.

When serialized in a textual HTTP field, Strings are delimited with double quotes, using a backslash ("\\") to escape double quotes and backslashes. For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-String: "hello world"
~~~

Note that Strings only use DQUOTE as a delimiter; single quotes do not delimit Strings. Furthermore, only DQUOTE and "\\" can be escaped; other characters after "\\" MUST cause parsing to fail.

Parsers MUST support Strings (after any decoding) with at least 1024 characters.


### Tokens {#token}

Tokens are short textual words that begin with an alphabetic character or "*", followed by zero to many token characters, which are the same as those allowed by the "token" ABNF rule defined in {{HTTP}}, plus the ":" and "/" characters.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-Token: foo123/456
~~~

Parsers MUST support Tokens with at least 512 characters.


### Byte Sequences {#binary}

Byte Sequences can be conveyed in Structured Fields.

When serialized in a textual HTTP field, a Byte Sequence is delimited with colons and encoded using base64 ({{RFC4648, Section 4}}). For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-ByteSequence: :cHJldGVuZCB0aGlzIGlzIGJpbmFyeSBjb250ZW50Lg==:
~~~

Parsers MUST support Byte Sequences with at least 16384 octets after decoding.


### Booleans {#boolean}

Boolean values can be conveyed in Structured Fields.

When serialized in a textual HTTP field, a Boolean is indicated with a leading "?" character followed by a "1" for a true value or "0" for false. For example:

~~~ http-message
Example-Boolean: ?1
~~~

Note that in Dictionary ({{dictionary}}) and Parameter ({{param}}) values, Boolean true is indicated by omitting the value.


### Dates {#date}

Date values can be conveyed in Structured Fields.

Dates have a data model that is similar to Integers, representing a (possibly negative) delta in seconds from January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC, excluding leap seconds.

For example:

~~~ http-message-new
Example-Date: @1659578233
~~~

### Display Strings {#displaystring}

Display Strings are similar to Strings, in that they consist of zero or more characters, but they allow Unicode content, unlike Strings.

Display Strings are intended for use in cases where a value is displayed to end users, and therefore may need to carry non-ASCII content. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that they be used in situations where a String ({{string}}) or Token ({{token}}) would be adequate, because Unicode has processing considerations (e.g., normalization) and security considerations (e.g., homograph attacks) that make it more difficult to handle correctly.

Note that Display Strings do not indicate the language used in the value; that can be done separately if necessary (e.g., with a parameter).

For example:

~~~ http-message-new
Example-DisplayString: %"This is intended for display to %c3%bcsers."
~~~

See {{security}} for additional security considerations when handling Display Strings.



# Working with Structured Fields in HTTP {#text}

This section defines how to serialize and parse Structured Fields in textual HTTP field values and other encodings compatible with them (e.g., in HTTP/2 {{RFC9113}} before compression with HPACK {{HPACK}}).

## Serializing Structured Fields {#text-serialize}

Given a structure defined in this specification, return an ASCII string suitable for use in an HTTP field value.

3. If the structure is a List, let output_string be the result of running Serializing a List ({{ser-list}}) with the structure.
2. Else, if the structure is a Dictionary, let output_string be the result of running Serializing a Dictionary ({{ser-dictionary}}) with the structure.
4. Else, if the structure is an Item, let output_string be the result of running Serializing an Item ({{ser-item}}) with the structure.

## Parsing Structured Fields {#text-parse}

When a receiving implementation parses HTTP fields that are known to be Structured Fields, it is important that care be taken, as there are a number of edge cases that can cause interoperability or even security problems. This section specifies the algorithm for doing so.

Given an array of bytes as input_bytes that represent the chosen field's field-value (which is empty if that field is not present) and field_type (one of "dictionary", "list", or "item"), return the parsed field value.

0. Convert input_bytes into an ASCII string input_string; if conversion fails, fail parsing.
1. Discard any leading SP characters from input_string.
2. If field_type is "list", let output be the result of running Parsing a List ({{parse-list}}) with input_string.
3. If field_type is "dictionary", let output be the result of running Parsing a Dictionary ({{parse-dictionary}}) with input_string.
4. If field_type is "item", let output be the result of running Parsing an Item ({{parse-item}}) with input_string.
5. Discard any leading SP characters from input_string.
6. If input_string is not empty, fail parsing.
7. Otherwise, return output.

When generating input_bytes, parsers MUST combine all field lines in the same section (header or trailer) that case-insensitively match the field name into one comma-separated field-value, as per {{Section 5.2 of HTTP}}; this assures that the entire field value is processed correctly.

For Lists and Dictionaries, this has the effect of correctly concatenating all of the field's lines, as long as individual members of the top-level data structure are not split across multiple field instances. The parsing algorithms for both types allow tab characters, since these might
be used to combine field lines by some implementations.

Strings split across multiple field lines will have unpredictable results, because one or more commas (with optional whitespace) will become part of the string output by the parser. Since concatenation might be done by an upstream intermediary, the results are not under the control of the serializer or the parser, even when they are both under the control of the same party.

Tokens, Integers, Decimals, and Byte Sequences cannot be split across multiple field lines because the inserted commas will cause parsing to fail.

Parsers MAY fail when processing a field value spread across multiple field lines, when one of those lines does not parse as that field. For example, a parsing handling an Example-String field that's defined as an sf-string is allowed to fail when processing this field section:

~~~ http-message
Example-String: "foo
Example-String: bar"
~~~

If parsing fails, either the entire field value MUST be ignored (i.e., treated as if the field were not present in the section), or alternatively the complete HTTP message MUST be treated as malformed. This is intentionally strict to improve interoperability and safety, and field specifications that use Structured Fields are not allowed to loosen this requirement.

Note that this requirement does not apply to an implementation that is not parsing the field; for example, an intermediary is not required to strip a failing field from a message before forwarding it.

Because some implementations of base64 do not allow rejection of encoded data that is not properly "=" padded (see {{RFC4648, Section 3.2}}), parsers SHOULD NOT fail when "=" padding is not present, unless they cannot be configured to do so.

Because some implementations of base64 do not allow rejection of encoded data that has non-zero pad bits (see {{RFC4648, Section 3.5}}), parsers SHOULD NOT fail when non-zero pad bits are present, unless they cannot be configured to do so.

This specification does not relax the requirements in {{RFC4648, Sections 3.1 and 3.3}}; therefore, parsers MUST fail on characters outside the base64 alphabet and on line feeds in encoded data.

      1. Let octet_hex be the result of consuming two characters from input_string. If there are not two characters, fail parsing.
      2. If octet_hex contains characters outside the range %x30-39 or %x61-66 (i.e., it is not in 0-9 or lowercase a-f), fail parsing.
      2. Let octet be the result of hex decoding octet_hex ({{Section 8 of !RFC4648}}).
      3. Append octet to byte_array.

      2. Append byte to byte_array.
4. Reached the end of input_string without finding a closing DQUOTE; fail parsing.


# IANA Considerations {#iana}

Please add the following note to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field Name Registry":

> The "Structured Type" column indicates the type of the field (per {{&SELF}}), if any, and may be
> "Dictionary", "List" or "Item".
>
> Note that field names beginning with characters other than ALPHA or "*" will not be able to be
> represented as a Structured Fields Token, and therefore may be incompatible with being mapped into
> fields that refer to it.

Then, add a new column, "Structured Type".

Then, add the indicated Structured Type for each existing registry entry listed in {{existing-fields}}.

# Security Considerations {#security}

The size of most types defined by Structured Fields is not limited; as a result, extremely large fields could be an attack vector (e.g., for resource consumption). Most HTTP implementations limit the sizes of individual fields as well as the overall header or trailer section size to mitigate such attacks.

It is possible for parties with the ability to inject new HTTP fields to change the meaning
of a Structured Field. In some circumstances, this will cause parsing to fail, but it is not possible to reliably fail in all such circumstances.

The Display String type can convey all possible Unicode code points without any form of sanitization; for example, they might contain unassigned code points, control points (including NUL), or non-characters. Therefore, applications consuming Display Strings need to consider strategies such as filtering or escaping untrusted content before displaying it. See also {{UNICODE-SECURITY}} and {{?I-D.draft-bray-unichars}}.

# Frequently Asked Questions {#faq}

## Why Not JSON?

Earlier proposals for Structured Fields were based upon JSON {{?RFC8259}}. However, constraining its use to make it suitable for HTTP fields required senders and recipients to implement specific additional handling.

For example, JSON has specification issues around large numbers and objects with duplicate members. Although advice for avoiding these issues is available (e.g., {{?RFC7493}}), it cannot be relied upon.

Likewise, JSON strings are by default Unicode strings, which have a number of potential interoperability issues (e.g., in comparison). Although implementers can be advised to avoid non-ASCII content where unnecessary, this is difficult to enforce.

Another example is JSON's ability to nest content to arbitrary depths. Since the resulting memory commitment might be unsuitable (e.g., in embedded and other limited server deployments), it's necessary to limit it in some fashion; however, existing JSON implementations have no such limits, and even if a limit is specified, it's likely that some field definition will find a need to violate it.

Because of JSON's broad adoption and implementation, it is difficult to impose such additional constraints across all implementations; some deployments would fail to enforce them, thereby harming interoperability. In short, if it looks like JSON, people will be tempted to use a JSON parser/serializer on field values.

Since a major goal for Structured Fields is to improve interoperability and simplify implementation, these concerns led to a format that requires a dedicated parser and serializer.

Additionally, there were widely shared feelings that JSON doesn't "look right" in HTTP fields.


# Implementation Notes

A generic implementation of this specification should expose the top-level serialize ({{text-serialize}}) and parse ({{text-parse}}) functions. They need not be functions; for example, it could be implemented as an object, with methods for each of the different top-level types.

For interoperability, it's important that generic implementations be complete and follow the algorithms closely; see {{strict}}. To aid this, a common test suite is being maintained by the community at \<https://github.com/httpwg/structured-field-tests\>.

Implementers should note that Dictionaries and Parameters are order-preserving maps. Some fields may not convey meaning in the ordering of these data types, but it should still be exposed so that it will be available to applications that need to use it.

Likewise, implementations should note that it's important to preserve the distinction between Tokens and Strings. While most programming languages have native types that map to the other types well, it may be necessary to create a wrapper "token" object or use a parameter on functions to assure that these types remain separate.

The serialization algorithm is defined in a way that it is not strictly limited to the data types defined in {{types}} in every case. For example, Decimals are designed to take broader input and round to allowed values.

Implementations are allowed to limit the size of different structures, subject to the minimums defined for each type. When a structure exceeds an implementation limit, that structure fails parsing or serialization.


# ABNF {#abnf}

This section uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation {{?RFC5234}} to illustrate expected syntax of Structured Fields. However, it cannot be used to validate their syntax, because it does not capture all requirements.

This section is non-normative. If there is disagreement between the parsing algorithms and ABNF, the specified algorithms take precedence.
