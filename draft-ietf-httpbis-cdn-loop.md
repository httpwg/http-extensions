# Introduction

In modern deployments of HTTP servers, it is common to interpose Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
in front of origin servers to improve end-user perceived latency, reduce operational costs, and
improve scalability and reliability of services.

Often, more than one CDN is in use by a given origin. This happens for a variety of reasons, such
as cost savings, arranging for failover should one CDN have issues, or to directly compare their
services.

As a result, it is not unknown for forwarding CDNs to be configured in a "loop" accidentally;
because routing is achieved through a combination of DNS and forwarding rules, and site
configurations are sometimes complex and managed by several parties.

When this happens, it is difficult to debug. Additionally, it sometimes isn't accidental; loops
between multiple CDNs be used as an attack vector (e.g., see {{loop-attack}}), especially if one
CDN unintentionally strips the loop detection headers of another.

This specification defines the CDN-Loop request header field for HTTP to enable secure
interoperability of forwarding CDNs. Having a header that is guaranteed not to be modified by other
CDNs that are used by a shared customer helps give each CDN additional confidence that any purpose
(debugging, data gathering, enforcement) that they use this header for is free from tampering due
to how that customer configured the other CDNs.


## Relationship to Via

HTTP defines the Via header field in {{!RFC7230}}, Section 5.7.1 for "tracking message forwards,
avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of senders along the
request/response chain."

In theory, Via could be used to identify these loops. However, in practice it is not used in this
fashion, because some HTTP servers use Via for other purposes -- in particular, some
implementations disable some HTTP/1.1 features when the Via header is present.


## Conventions and Definitions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.

This specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of {{!RFC5234}} with a list
extension, defined in Section 7 of {{!RFC7230}}, that allows for compact definition of
comma-separated lists using a ‘#’ operator (similar to how the ‘*’ operator indicates repetition).
Additionally, it uses the OWS rule from {{!RFC7230}} and the parameter rule from {{!RFC7231}}.


# The CDN-Loop Request Header Field {#header}

The CDN-Loop request header field is intended to help a Content Delivery Network identify when an incoming request has already passed through that CDN's servers, to prevent loops.

~~~ abnf
CDN-Loop = #cdn-id
cdn-id   = token *( OWS ";" OWS parameter )
~~~

Conforming Content Delivery Networks SHOULD add a value to this header field to all requests they
generate or forward (creating the header if necessary).

The token identifies the CDN as a whole. Chosen token values SHOULD be unique enough that a
collision with other CDNs is unlikely. Optionally, the token can have semicolon-separated key/value
parameters, to accommodate additional information for the CDN's use.

As with all HTTP headers defined using the "#" rule, the CDN-Loop header can be added to by comma-separating values, or by creating a new header field with the desired value.

For example:

~~~ example
CDN-Loop: FooCDN, barcdn; host="foo123.bar.cdn"
CDN-Loop: baz-cdn; abc="123"; def="456", anotherCDN
~~~

Note that the token syntax does not allow whitespace, DQUOTE or any of the characters
"(),/:;<=>?@[\]{}". See {{!RFC7230}}, Section 3.2.6. Likewise, note the rules for when parameter
values need to be quoted in {{!RFC7231}}, Section 3.1.1.

To be effective, intermediaries -- including Content Delivery Networks -- MUST NOT remove this
header field, or allow it to be removed (e.g., through configuration) and servers (including
intermediaries) SHOULD NOT use it for other purposes.


# Security Considerations

The threat model that the CDN-Loop header field addresses is a customer who is attempting to attack
a service provider by configuring a forwarding loop by accident or malice. For it to function, CDNs cannot allow it to be modified by customers (see {{header}}).

The CDN-Loop header field can be generated by any client, and therefore its contents cannot be
trusted. CDNs who modify their behaviour based upon its contents should assure that this does not
become an attack vector (e.g., for Denial-of-Service).

It is possible to sign the contents of the header (either by putting the signature directly into
the field's content, or using another header field), but such use is not defined (or required) by
this specification.



# IANA Considerations

This document registers the "CDN-Loop" header field in the Permanent Message Header Field Names registry.
