# Introduction

HTTP {{!RFC7230}} is often used as a substrate for other application protocols. This is done for a
variety of reasons, including:

* familiarity by implementers, specifiers, administrators, developers and users,
* availability of a variety of client, server and proxy implementations,
* ease of use,
* ubiquity of Web browsers,
* reuse of existing mechanisms like authentication and encryption,
* presence of HTTP servers and clients in target deployments, and
* its ability to traverse firewalls.

The Internet community has a long tradition of protocol reuse, dating back to the use of Telnet
{{?RFC0854}} as a substrate for FTP {{?RFC0959}} and SMTP {{?RFC2821}}. However, layering new
protocols over HTTP brings its own set of issues:

* Should an application using HTTP define a new URL scheme? Use new ports?
* Should it use standard HTTP methods and status codes, or define new ones?
* How can the maximum value be extracted from the use of HTTP?
* How does it coexist with other uses of HTTP -- especially Web browsing?
* How can interoperability problems and "protocol dead ends" be avoided?

This document contains best current practices regarding the use of HTTP by applications other than
Web browsing. {{used}} defines what applications it applies to; {{overview}} surveys the properties
of HTTP that are important to preserve, and {{bp}} conveys best practices for those applications
that do use HTTP.

It is written primarily to guide IETF efforts to define application protocols using HTTP for
deployment on the Internet, but might be applicable in other situations. Note that the requirements
herein do not necessarily apply to the development of generic HTTP extensions.

## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.


# Is HTTP Being Used? {#used}

Different applications have different goals when using HTTP. In this document, we say an
application is _using HTTP_ when any of the following conditions are true:

* The transport port in use is 80 or 443,
* The URL scheme "http" or "https" is used,
* The ALPN protocol ID {{!RFC7301}} generically identifies HTTP (e.g., "http/1.1", "h2", "h2c"), or
* The IANA registries defined for HTTP are updated or modified.

When an application is using HTTP, all of the requirements of the HTTP protocol suite (including
but not limited to {{!RFC7230}}, {{!RFC7231}}, {{!RFC7232}}, {{!RFC7233}}, {{!RFC7234}},
{{!RFC7235}} and {{!RFC7540}}) are in force.

An application might not be _using HTTP_ according to this definition, but still relying upon the
HTTP specifications in some manner. For example, an application might wish to avoid re-specifying
parts of the message format, but change others; or, it might want to use a different set of methods.

Such applications are referred to as _protocols based upon HTTP_ in this document. These have more
freedom to modify protocol operation, but are also likely to lose at least a portion of the
benefits outlined above, as most HTTP implementations won't be easily adaptable to these changes,
and as the protocol diverges from HTTP, the benefit of mindshare will be lost.

Protocols that are based upon HTTP MUST NOT reuse HTTP's URL schemes, transport ports, ALPN
protocol IDs or IANA registries; rather, they are encouraged to establish their own.


# What's Important About HTTP {#overview}

There are many ways that applications using HTTP are defined and deployed, and sometimes they are
brought to the IETF for standardisation. In that process, what might be workable for deployment in
a limited fashion isn't appropriate for standardisation and the corresponding broader deployment.

This section examines the facets of the protocol that are important to preserve in these situations.


## Generic Semantics

When writing an application's specification, it's often tempting to specify exactly how HTTP is to
be implemented, supported and used.

However, this can easily lead to an unintended profile of HTTP's behaviour. For example, it's
common to see specifications with language like this:

    A `200 OK` response means that the widget has successfully been
    updated.

This sort of specification is bad practice, because it is adding new semantics to HTTP's status
codes and methods, respectively; a recipient -- whether it's an origin server, client library,
intermediary or cache -- now has to know these extra semantics to understand the message.

Some applications even require specific behaviours, such as:

    A `POST` request MUST result in a `201 Created` response.

This forms an expectation in the client that the response will always be `201 Created`, when in
fact there are a number of reasons why the status code might differ in a real deployment. If the
client does not anticipate this, the application's deployment is brittle.

Much of the value of HTTP is in its _generic semantics_ -- that is, the protocol elements defined
by HTTP are potentially applicable to every resource, not specific to a particular context.
Application-specific semantics are expressed in the payload; mostly, in the body, but also in
header fields.

This allows a HTTP message to be examined by generic HTTP software (e.g., HTTP servers,
intermediaries, client implementations), and its handling to be correctly determined. It also
allows people to leverage their knowledge of HTTP semantics without special-casing them for a
particular application.

Therefore, applications that use HTTP MUST NOT re-define, refine or overlay the semantics of
defined protocol elements. Instead, they SHOULD focus their specifications on protocol elements
that are specific to that application; namely their HTTP resources.

See {{resource}} for details.


## Links

Another common practice is assuming that the HTTP server's name space (or a portion thereof) is
exclusively for the use of a single application. This effectively overlays special,
application-specific semantics onto that space, precludes other applications from using it.

As explained in {{!RFC7320}}, such "squatting" on a part of the URL space by a standard usurps the
server's authority over its own resources, can cause deployment issues, and is therefore bad
practice in standards.

Instead of statically defining URL components like paths, it is RECOMMENDED that applications using
HTTP define links in payloads, to allow flexibility in deployment.

Using runtime links in this fashion has a number of other benefits. For example, navigating with a
link allows a request to be routed to a different server without the overhead of a redirection,
thereby supporting deployment across machines well. It becomes possible to "mix" different
applications on the same server, and offers a natural path for extensibility, versioning and
capability management.


## Getting Value from HTTP

The simplest possible use of HTTP is to POST data to a single URL, thereby effectively tunnelling
through the protocol.

This "RPC" style of communication does get some benefit from using HTTP -- namely, message framing and the availability of implementations -- but fails to realise many others when used exclusively:

* Caching for server scalability, latency and bandwidth reduction, and reliability;
* Granularity of access control (through use of a rich space of URLs);
* Partial content to selectively request part of a response;
* Definition of an information space using URLs; and
* The ability to interact with the application easily using a Web browser.

Using such a high-level protocol to tunnel simple semantics has downsides too; because of its more
advanced capabilities, breadth of deployment and age, HTTP's complexity can cause interoperability
problems that could be avoided by using a simpler substrate (e.g., WebSockets {{?RFC6455}}, if
browser support is necessary, or TCP {{?RFC0793}} if not), or making the application be _based upon
HTTP_, instead of using it (as defined in {{used}}).

Applications that use HTTP are encouraged to accommodate the various features that the protocol
offers, so that their users receive the maximum benefit from it. This document does not require
specific features to be used, since the appropriate design tradeoffs are highly specific to a given
situation. However, following the practices in {{bp}} will help make them available.



# Best Practices for Using HTTP {#bp}

This section contains best practices regarding the use of HTTP by applications, including practices
for specific HTTP protocol elements.


## Specifying the Use of HTTP

When specifying the use of HTTP, an application SHOULD use {{!RFC7230}} as the primary reference;
it is not necessary to reference all of the specifications in the HTTP suite unless there are
specific reasons to do so (e.g., a particular feature is called out).

Applications using HTTP MAY specify a minimum version to be supported (HTTP/1.1 is suggested), and
MUST NOT specify a maximum version.

Likewise, applications need not specify what HTTP mechanisms -- such as redirection, caching,
authentication, proxy authentication, and so on -- are to be supported. Full featured support for
HTTP SHOULD be taken for granted in servers and clients, and the application's function SHOULD
degrade gracefully if they are not (although this might be achieved by informing the user that
their task cannot be completed).

For example, an application can specify that it uses HTTP like this:

    Foo Application uses HTTP {{!RFC7230}}. Implementations MUST support
    HTTP/1.1, and MAY support later versions. Support for common HTTP
    mechanisms such as redirection and caching are assumed.

When specifying examples of protocol interactions, applications SHOULD document both the request
and response messages, with full headers, preferably in HTTP/1.1 format. For example:

~~~
GET /thing HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/things+json
User-Agent: Foo/1.0

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/things+json
Content-Length: 500
Server: Bar/2.2

[payload here]
~~~


## Defining HTTP Resources {#resource}

HTTP Applications SHOULD focus on defining the following application-specific protocol elements:

* Media types {{!RFC6838}}, often based upon a format convention such as JSON {{?RFC8259}},
* HTTP header fields, as per {{headers}}, and
* The behaviour of resources, as identified by link relations {{!RFC8288}}.

By composing these protocol elements, an application can define a set of resources, identified by
link relations, that implement specified behaviours, including:

* Retrieval of their state using GET, in one or more formats identified by media type;
* Resource creation or update using POST or PUT, with an appropriately identified request body format;
* Data processing using POST and identified request and response body format(s); and
* Resource deletion using DELETE.

For example, an application might specify:

    Resources linked to with the "example-widget" link relation type are
    Widgets. The state of a Widget can be fetched in the
    "application/example-widget+json" format, and can be updated by PUT
    to the same link. Widget resources can be deleted.

    The "Example-Count" response header field on Widget representations
    indicates how many Widgets are held by the sender.

    The "application/example-widget+json" format is a JSON {{?RFC8259}}
    format representing the state of a Widget. It contains links to
    related information in the link indicated by the Link header field
    value with the "example-other-info" link relation type.

## Specifying Client Behaviours {#clients}

HTTP does not mandate some behaviours that have nevertheless become very common; if these are not
explicitly specified by applications using HTTP, there may be confusing or interoperability
problems. This section lists common examples of this, and recommends default handling for them.

* Redirect handling - applications using HTTP SHOULD specify that 3xx redirect status codes be followed automatically. See {{!RFC7231}}, Section 6.4.
* Redirect methods - applications using HTTP SHOULD specify that 301 and 302 redirect status codes rewrite the POST method to GET. See {{!RFC7231}}, Section 6.4.
* Cookies - Applications using HTTP MUST explicitly reference the Cookie specification {{?RFC6265}} if they are required.
* Certificates - Applications using HTTP MUST specify that TLS certificates are to be checked according to {{!RFC2818}} when HTTPS is used.

In general, applications using HTTP SHOULD align their usage as closely as possible with Web browsers, to avoid interoperability issues when they are used. See {{browser}}.

Applications using HTTP MUST NOT require HTTP features that are usually negotiated to be supported.
For example, requiring that clients support responses with a certain content-encoding
({{?RFC7231}}, Section 3.1.2.2) instead of negotiating for it ({{?RFC7231}}, Section 5.3.4) means
that otherwise conformant clients cannot interoperate with the application. Applications MAY
encourage the implementation of such features, though.


## HTTP URLs

In HTTP, URLs are opaque identifiers under the control of the server. As outlined in {{!RFC7320}},
standards cannot usurp this space, since it might conflict with existing resources, and constrain
implementation and deployment.

In other words, applications that use HTTP MUST NOT associate application semantics with specific
URL paths on arbitrary servers. Doing so inappropriately conflates the identity of the resource (its URL) with the capabilities that resource supports, bringing about many of the same interoperability problems that {{?RFC4367}} warns of.

For example, specifying that a "GET to the URL /foo retrieves a bar document" is bad practice.
Likewise, specifying "The widget API is at the path /bar" violates {{!RFC7320}}.

Instead, applications that use HTTP are encouraged to ensure that URLs are discovered at runtime,
allowing HTTP-based services to describe their own capabilities. One way to do this is to use typed
links {{?RFC8288}} to convey the URIs that are in use, as well as the semantics of the resources
that they identify. See {{resource}} for details.


### Initial URL Discovery

Generally, a client will begin interacting with a given application server by requesting an initial
document that contains information about that particular deployment, potentially including links to
other relevant resources.

Applications that use HTTP SHOULD allow an arbitrary URL to be used as that entry point. For
example, rather than specifying "the initial document is at "/foo/v1", they should allow a
deployment to use any URL as the entry point for the application.

In cases where doing so is impractical (e.g., it is not possible to convey a whole URL, but only a
hostname) standard applications that use HTTP can request a well-known URL {{?RFC5785}} as an entry
point.

### URL Schemes {#scheme}

Applications that use HTTP will typically use the "http" and/or "https" URL schemes. "https" is preferred to provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality, as well as mitigate pervasive monitoring attacks {{?RFC7258}}.

However, application-specific schemes can be defined as well.

When defining an URL scheme for an application using HTTP, there are a number of tradeoffs and
caveats to keep in mind:

* Unmodified Web browsers will not support the new scheme. While it is possible to register new URL schemes with Web browsers (e.g. registerProtocolHandler() in {{HTML5}} Section 8.7.1.3, as well as several proprietary approaches), support for these mechanisms is not shared by all browsers, and their capabilities vary.

* Existing non-browser clients, intermediaries, servers and associated software will not recognise the new scheme. For example, a client library might fail to dispatch the request; a cache might refuse to store the response, and a proxy might fail to forward the request.

* Because URLs occur in and are generated in HTTP artefacts commonly, often without human intervention (e.g., in the `Location` response header), it can be difficult to assure that the new scheme is used consistently.

* The resources identified by the new scheme will still be available using "http" and/or "https" URLs. Those URLs can "leak" into use, which can present security and operability issues. For example, using a new scheme to assure that requests don't get sent to a "normal" Web site is likely to fail.

* Features that rely upon the URL's origin {{?RFC6454}}, such as the Web's same-origin policy, will be impacted by a change of scheme.

* HTTP-specific features such as cookies {{?RFC6265}}, authentication {{?RFC7235}}, caching {{?RFC7234}}, and CORS {{FETCH}} might or might not work correctly, depending on how they are defined and implemented. Generally, they are designed and implemented with an assumption that the URL will always be "http" or "https".

* Web features that require a secure context {{?SECCTXT=W3C.CR-secure-contexts-20160915}} will likely treat a new scheme as insecure.


See {{?RFC7595}} for more information about minting new URL schemes.



### Transport Ports

Applications that use HTTP can use the applicable default port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS), or
they can be deployed upon other ports. This decision can be made at deployment time, or might be
encouraged by the application's specification (e.g., by registering a port for that application).

In either case, non-default ports will need to be reflected in the authority of all URLs for that
resource; the only mechanism for changing a default port is changing the scheme (see {{scheme}}).

Using a port other than the default has privacy implications (i.e., the protocol can now be
distinguished from other traffic), as well as operability concerns (as some networks might block or
otherwise interfere with it). Privacy implications SHOULD be documented in Security Considerations.

See {{?RFC7605}} for further guidance.


## HTTP Methods

Applications that use HTTP MUST confine themselves to using registered HTTP methods such as GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.

New HTTP methods are rare; they are required to be registered with IETF Review (see {{!RFC7232}}),
and are also required to be *generic*. That means that they need to be potentially applicable to
all resources, not just those of one application.

While historically some applications (e.g., {{?RFC4791}}) have defined non-generic methods,
{{!RFC7231}} now forbids this.

When authors believe that a new method is required, they are encouraged to engage with the HTTP
community early, and document their proposal as a separate HTTP extension, rather than as part of
an application's specification.


## HTTP Status Codes

Applications that use HTTP MUST only use registered HTTP status codes.

As with methods, new HTTP status codes are rare, and required (by {{!RFC7231}}) to be registered
with IETF review. Similarly, HTTP status codes are generic; they are required (by {{!RFC7231}}) to
be potentially applicable to all resources, not just to those of one application.

When authors believe that a new status code is required, they are encouraged to engage with the
HTTP community early, and document their proposal as a separate HTTP extension, rather than as part
of an application's specification.

The primary function of status codes is to convey HTTP semantics for the benefit of generic HTTP
software, not application-specific semantics. Therefore, applications MUST NOT specify additional
semantics or refine existing semantics for status codes.

In particular, specifying that a particular status code has a specific meaning in the context of an
application is harmful, as these are not generic semantics, since the consumer needs to be in the
context of the application to understand them.

Furthermore, applications using HTTP MUST NOT re-specify the semantics of HTTP status codes, even
if it is only by copying their definition. They MUST NOT require specific reason phrases to be
used; the reason phrase has no function in HTTP, and is not guaranteed to be preserved by
implementations. The reason phrase is not carried in the {{RFC7540}} message format.

Typically, applications using HTTP will convey application-specific information in the message body
and/or HTTP header fields, not the status code.

Specifications sometimes also create a "laundry list" of potential status codes, in an effort to be
helpful. The problem with doing so is that such a list is never complete; for example, if a network
proxy is interposed, the client might encounter a `407 Proxy Authentication Required` response; or,
if the server is rate limiting the client, it might receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

Since the list of HTTP status codes can be added to, it's safer to refer to it directly, and point
out that clients SHOULD be able to handle all applicable protocol elements gracefully (i.e.,
falling back to the generic `n00` semantics of a given status code; e.g., `499` can be safely
handled as `400` by clients that don't recognise it).


## HTTP Header Fields {#headers}

Applications that use HTTP MAY define new HTTP header fields, following the advice in {{!RFC7231}},
Section 8.3.1.

Typically, using HTTP header fields is appropriate in a few different situations:

* Their content is useful to intermediaries (who often wish to avoid parsing the body), and/or
* Their content is useful to generic HTTP software (e.g., clients, servers), and/or
* It is not possible to include their content in the message body (usually because a format does not allow it).

If none of these motivations apply, using a header field is NOT RECOMMENDED.

New header fields MUST be registered, as per {{!RFC7231}} and {{!RFC3864}}.

It is RECOMMENDED that header field names be short (even when HTTP/2 header compression is in
effect, there is an overhead) but appropriately specific. In particular, if a header field is
specific to an application, an identifier for that application SHOULD form a prefix to the header
field name, separated by a "-".

For example, if the "example" application needs to create three headers, they might be called
"example-foo", "example-bar" and "example-baz". Note that the primary motivation here is to avoid
consuming more generic header names, not to reserve a portion of the namespace for the application;
see {{!RFC6648}} for related considerations.

The semantics of existing HTTP header fields MUST NOT be re-defined without updating their
registration or defining an extension to them (if allowed). For example, an application using HTTP
cannot specify that the `Location` header has a special meaning in a certain context.

If an application defines a request header field that might be used by a server to change the
response's headers or body, authors should point out that this has implications for caching; in
general, such resources need to either make their responses uncacheable (e.g., with the "no-store"
cache-control directive defined in {{!RFC7234}}, Section 5.2.2.3) or consistently send the Vary
response header ({{!RFC7231}}, Section 7.1.4).

See {{state}} for requirements regarding header fields that carry application state (e.g,. Cookie).

Applications that use already-defined HTTP header fields MUST NOT modify their semantics or syntax,
unless the definition of that header field explicitly allows it (e.g., with an extension field).


## Defining Message Payloads {#payload}

There are many potential formats for payloads; for example, JSON {{?RFC8259}}, XML
{{?XML=W3C.REC-xml-20081126}}, and CBOR {{?RFC7049}}. Best practices for their use are out of scope for
this document.

Applications SHOULD register distinct media types for each format they define; this makes it
possible to identify them unambiguously and negotiate for their use. See {{!RFC6838}} for more
information.


## Authentication and Application State {#state}

Applications that use HTTP MAY use stateful cookies {{?RFC6265}} to identify a client and/or store
client-specific data to contextualise requests.

If it is only necessary to identify clients, applications that use HTTP MAY use HTTP authentication
{{?RFC7235}}. If the Basic authentication scheme {{?RFC7617}} is used, it MUST NOT be used with the
'http' URL scheme. If the Digest scheme {{?RFC7616}} is used, it MUST NOT be used with the 'http'
URL scheme, unless the chosen hash algorithm is not "MD5".

In either case, it is important to carefully specify the scoping and use of these mechanisms; if
they expose sensitive data or capabilities (e.g., by acting as an ambient authority), exploits are
possible. Mitigations include using a request-specific token to assure the intent of the client.

Applications MUST NOT make assumptions about the relationship between separate requests on a single
transport connection; doing so breaks many of the assumptions of HTTP as a stateless protocol, and
will cause problems in interoperability, security, operability and evolution.


## Co-Existing with Web Browsing {#browser}

Even if there is not an intent for an application that uses HTTP to be used with a Web browser, its
resources will remain available to browsers and other HTTP clients.

This means that all such applications need to consider how browsers will interact with them,
particularly regarding security.

For example, if an application's state can be changed using a POST request, a Web browser can
easily be coaxed into making that request by a HTML form on an arbitrary Web site.

Or, if a resource reflects data from the request into a response, that can be used to perform a
Cross-Site Scripting attack on Web browsers directed to it.

This is only a small sample of the kinds of issues that applications using HTTP must consider.
Generally, the best approach is to consider the application *as* a Web application, and to follow
best practices for their secure development.

A complete enumeration of such practices is out of scope for this document. External resources are
numerous; e.g., <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Guide_Project>.


## Co-Existing with Other Applications {#other-apps}

Because the origin {{!RFC6454}} is how many HTTP capabilities are scoped, applications also need to
consider how deployments might interact with other applications (including Web browsing) on the
same origin.

For example, if Cookies {{?RFC6265}} are used to carry application state, they will be sent with
all requests to the origin by default, unless scoped by path, and the application might receive
cookies from other applications on the origin. This can lead to security issues, as well as
collisions in cookie name.

As a result, when specifying the use of Cookies, HTTP authentication {{?RFC7235}}, or other
origin-wide HTTP mechanisms, applications using HTTP SHOULD NOT mandate the use of a particular
identifier, but instead let deployments configure them.

Note that dedicating a hostname to a single application is not a solution to the issues above; see
{{!RFC7320}}.

Modern Web browsers constrain the ability of content from one origin to access resources from
another, to avoid the "confused deputy" problem. As a result, applications that wish to expose
cross-origin data to browsers will need to implement {{!W3C.REC-cors-20140116}}.



# IANA Considerations

This document has no requirements for IANA.

# Security Considerations

{{state}} discusses the impact of using stateful mechanisms in the protocol as ambient authority,
and suggests a mitigation.

{{scheme}} requires support for 'https' URLs, and discourages the use of 'http' URLs, to provide
authentication, integrity and confidentiality, as well as mitigate pervasive monitoring attacks.

{{browser}} highlights the implications of Web browsers' capabilities on applications that use HTTP.

{{other-apps}} discusses the issues that arise when applications are deployed on the same origin
as Web sites (and other applications).

Applications that use HTTP in a manner that involves modification of implementations -- for
example, requiring support for a new URL scheme, or a non-standard method -- risk having those
implementations "fork" from their parent HTTP implementations, with the possible result that they
do not benefit from patches and other security improvements incorporated upstream.

# Changes from RFC 3205

{{?RFC3205}} captured the Best Current Practice in the early 2000's, based on the concerns facing
protocol designers at the time. Use of HTTP has changed considerably since then, and as a result
this document is substantially different. As a result, the changes are too numerous to list
individually.
