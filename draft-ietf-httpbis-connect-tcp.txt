             Template-Driven HTTP CONNECT Proxying for TCP
                 draft-ietf-httpbis-connect-tcp-latest

Abstract

   TCP proxying using HTTP CONNECT has long been part of the core HTTP
   specification.  However, this proxying functionality has several
   important deficiencies in modern HTTP environments.  This
   specification defines an alternative HTTP proxy service configuration
   for TCP connections.  This configuration is described by a URI
   Template, similar to the CONNECT-UDP and CONNECT-IP protocols.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  History

   HTTP has used the CONNECT method for proxying TCP connections since
   HTTP/1.1.  When using CONNECT, the request target specifies a host
   and port number, and the proxy forwards TCP payloads between the
   client and this destination ([RFC9110], Section 9.3.6).  To date,
   this is the only mechanism defined for proxying TCP over HTTP.  In
   this specification, this is referred to as a "classic HTTP CONNECT
   proxy".

   HTTP/3 uses a UDP transport, so it cannot be forwarded using the pre-
   existing CONNECT mechanism.  To enable forward proxying of HTTP/3,
   the MASQUE effort has defined proxy mechanisms that are capable of
   proxying UDP datagrams [CONNECT-UDP], and more generally IP datagrams
   [CONNECT-IP].  The destination host and port number (if applicable)
   are encoded into the HTTP resource path, and end-to-end datagrams are
   wrapped into HTTP Datagrams [RFC9297] on the client-proxy path.

1.2.  Problems

   HTTP clients can be configured to use proxies by selecting a proxy
   hostname, a port, and whether to use a security protocol.  However,
   Classic HTTP CONNECT requests using the proxy do not carry this
   configuration information.  Instead, they only indicate the hostname
   and port of the target.  This prevents any HTTP server from hosting
   multiple distinct proxy services, as the server cannot distinguish
   them by path (as with distinct resources) or by origin (as in
   "virtual hosting").

   The absence of an explicit origin for the proxy also rules out the
   usual defenses against server port misdirection attacks (see
   Section 7.4 of [RFC9110]) and creates ambiguity about the use of
   origin-scoped response header fields (e.g., "Alt-Svc" [RFC7838],
   "Strict-Transport-Security" [RFC6797]).

   Classic HTTP CONNECT requests cannot carry in-stream metadata.  For
   example, the WRAP_UP capsule [I-D.schinazi-httpbis-wrap-up] cannot be
   used with Classic HTTP CONNECT.

1.3.  Overview

   This specification describes an alternative mechanism for proxying
   TCP in HTTP.  Like [CONNECT-UDP] and [CONNECT-IP], the proxy service
   is identified by a URI Template.  Proxy interactions reuse standard
   HTTP components and semantics, avoiding changes to the core HTTP
   protocol.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

   A template-driven TCP transport proxy for HTTP is identified by a URI
   Template [RFC6570] containing variables named "target_host" and
   "target_port".  This URI Template and its variable values MUST meet
   all the same requirements as for UDP proxying ([RFC9298], Section 2),
   and are subject to the same validation rules.  The client MUST
   substitute the destination host and port number into this template to
   produce the request URI.  The derived URI serves as the destination
   of a Capsule Protocol connection using the Upgrade Token "connect-
   tcp" (see registration in Section 8.1).

   When using "connect-tcp", TCP payload data is sent in the payload of
   a new Capsule Type named DATA (see registration in Section 8.3).  The
   ordered concatenation of DATA capsule payloads represents the TCP
   payload data.

   An intermediary MAY merge and split successive DATA capsules, subject
   to the following requirements:

   *  There are no intervening capsules of other types.

   *  The order of payload content is preserved.

3.1.  In HTTP/1.1

   In HTTP/1.1, the client uses the proxy by issuing a request as
   follows:

   *  The method SHALL be "GET".

   *  The request's target SHALL correspond to the URI derived from
      expansion of the proxy's URI Template.

   *  The request SHALL include a single "Host" header field containing
      the origin of the proxy.

   *  The request SHALL include a "Connection" header field with the
      value "Upgrade".  (Note that this requirement is case-insensitive
      as per Section 7.6.1 of [RFC9110].)

   *  The request SHALL include an "Upgrade" header field with the value
      "connect-tcp".

   *  The request SHOULD include a "Capsule-Protocol: ?1" header.

   If the request is well-formed and permissible, the proxy MUST attempt
   to establish the TCP connection before sending any response status
   code other than "100 (Continue)" (see Section 4.2).  If the TCP
   connection is successful, the response SHALL be as follows:

   *  The HTTP status code SHALL be "101 (Switching Protocols)".

   *  The response SHALL include a "Connection" header field with the
      value "Upgrade".

   *  The response SHALL include a single "Upgrade" header field with
      the value "connect-tcp".

   *  The response SHOULD include a "Capsule-Protocol: ?1" header.

   If the request is malformed or impermissible, the proxy MUST return a
   4XX error code.  If a TCP connection was not established, the proxy
   MUST NOT switch protocols to "connect-tcp", and the client MAY reuse
   this connection for additional HTTP requests.

   Client                                                 Proxy

   GET /proxy?target_host=192.0.2.1&target_port=443 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com
   Connection: Upgrade
   Upgrade: connect-tcp
   Capsule-Protocol: ?1

   ** Proxy establishes a TCP connection to 192.0.2.1:443 **

                               HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
                               Connection: Upgrade
                               Upgrade: connect-tcp
                               Capsule-Protocol: ?1

             Figure 1: Templated TCP proxy example in HTTP/1.1

3.2.  In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

   In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the proxy MUST include
   SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL in its SETTINGS frame
   [RFC8441][RFC9220].  The client uses the proxy by issuing an
   "extended CONNECT" request as follows:

   *  The :method pseudo-header field SHALL be "CONNECT".

   *  The :protocol pseudo-header field SHALL be "connect-tcp".

   *  The :authority pseudo-header field SHALL contain the authority of
      the proxy.

   *  The :path and :scheme pseudo-header fields SHALL contain the path
      and scheme of the request URI derived from the proxy's URI
      Template.

   A templated TCP proxying request that does not conform to all of
   these requirements represents a client error (see [RFC9110],
   Section 15.5) and may be malformed (see Section 8.1.1 of [RFC9113]
   and Section 4.1.2 of [RFC9114]).

   HEADERS
   :method = CONNECT
   :scheme = https
   :authority = request-proxy.example
   :path = /proxy?target_host=2001%3Adb8%3A%3A1&target_port=443
   :protocol = connect-tcp
   capsule-protocol = ?1
   ...

              Figure 2: Templated TCP proxy example in HTTP/2

3.3.  Use of Other Relevant Headers

3.3.1.  Origin-scoped Headers

   Ordinary HTTP headers apply only to the single resource identified in
   the request or response.  An origin-scoped HTTP header is a special
   response header that is intended to change the client's behavior for
   subsequent requests to any resource on this origin.

   Unlike classic HTTP CONNECT proxies, a templated TCP proxy has an
   unambiguous origin of its own.  Origin-scoped headers apply to this
   origin when they are associated with a templated TCP proxy response.
   Here are some origin-scoped headers that could potentially be sent by
   a templated TCP proxy:

   *  "Alt-Svc" [RFC7838]

   *  "Strict-Transport-Security" [RFC6797]

   *  "Public-Key-Pins" [RFC7469]

   *  "Accept-CH" [RFC8942]

   *  "Set-Cookie" [RFC6265], which has configurable scope.

   *  "Clear-Site-Data" [CLEAR-SITE-DATA]

3.3.2.  Authentication Headers

   Authentication to a templated TCP proxy normally uses ordinary HTTP
   authentication via the "401 (Unauthorized)" response code, the "WWW-
   Authenticate" response header field, and the "Authorization" request
   header field ([RFC9110], Section 11.6).  A templated TCP proxy does
   not use the "407 (Proxy Authentication Required)" response code and
   related header fields ([RFC9110], Section 11.7) because they do not
   traverse HTTP gateways (see Section 7).

   Clients SHOULD assume that all proxy resources generated by a single
   template share a protection space (i.e., a realm) ([RFC9110],
   Section 11.5).  For many authentication schemes, this will allow the
   client to avoid waiting for a "401 (Unauthorized)" response before
   each new connection through the proxy.

3.4.  Closing Connections

   In each HTTP version, any requirements related to closing connections
   in Classic HTTP CONNECT also apply to "connect-tcp", with the
   following modifications:

   *  In HTTP/1.1, endpoints SHOULD close the connection in an error
      state to indicate receipt of a TCP connection error (e.g., a TCP
      RST or timeout).  Acceptable error states include sending an
      incomplete DATA capsule (as defined in Section 3.3 of [RFC9297]),
      a TLS Error Alert ([RFC8446], Section 6.2), or a TCP RST (if TLS
      is not in use).  When a connection is terminated in an error
      state, the receiving endpoint SHOULD send a TCP RST if the
      underlying TCP implementation permits it.

   *  In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, senders MAY use an incomplete DATA capsule
      to indicate a TCP connection error, instead of (or in addition to)
      the signals defined for TCP connection errors in Classic HTTP
      CONNECT.  Recipients MUST recognize any incomplete capsule as a
      TCP connection error.

   *  Intermediaries MUST propagate connection shutdown errors,
      including when translating between different HTTP versions.

4.  Additional Connection Setup Behaviors

   This section discusses some behaviors that are permitted or
   recommended in order to enhance the performance or functionality of
   connection setup.

4.1.  Latency optimizations

   When using this specification in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, clients MAY start
   sending TCP stream content optimistically, subject to flow control
   limits (Section 5.2 of [RFC9113] or Section 4.1 of [RFC9000]).
   Proxies MUST buffer this "optimistic" content until the TCP stream
   becomes writable, and discard it if the TCP connection fails.
   (Clients MUST NOT use "optimistic" behavior in HTTP/1.1, as this
   would interfere with reuse of the connection after an error response
   such as "401 (Unauthorized)".)

   Servers that host a proxy under this specification MAY offer support
   for TLS early data in accordance with [RFC8470].  Clients MAY send
   "connect-tcp" requests in early data, and MAY include "optimistic"
   TCP content in early data (in HTTP/2 and HTTP/3).  At the TLS layer,
   proxies MAY ignore, reject, or accept the early_data extension
   ([RFC8446], Section 4.2.10).  At the HTTP layer, proxies MAY process
   the request immediately, return a "425 (Too Early)" response
   ([RFC8470], Section 5.2), or delay some or all processing of the
   request until the handshake completes.  For example, a proxy with
   limited anti-replay defenses might choose to perform DNS resolution
   of the target_host when a request arrives in early data, but delay
   the TCP connection until the TLS handshake completes.

4.2.  Conveying metadata

   This specification supports the "Expect: 100-continue" request header
   ([RFC9110], Section 10.1.1) in any HTTP version.  The "100
   (Continue)" status code confirms receipt of a request at the proxy
   without waiting for the proxy-destination TCP handshake to succeed or
   fail.  This might be particularly helpful when the destination host
   is not responding, as TCP handshakes can hang for several minutes
   before failing.  Clients MAY send "Expect: 100-continue", and proxies
   MUST respect it by returning "100 (Continue)" if the request is not
   immediately rejected.

   Proxies implementing this specification SHOULD include a "Proxy-
   Status" response header [RFC9209] in any success or failure response
   (i.e., status codes 101, 2XX, 4XX, or 5XX) to support advanced client
   behaviors and diagnostics.  In HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, proxies MAY
   additionally send a "Proxy-Status" trailer in the event of an unclean
   shutdown.

5.  Applicability

5.1.  Servers

   For server operators, template-driven TCP proxies are particularly
   valuable in situations where virtual-hosting is needed, or where
   multiple proxies must share an origin.  For example, the proxy might
   benefit from sharing an HTTP gateway that provides DDoS defense,
   performs request sanitization, or enforces user authorization.

   The URI template can also be structured to generate high-entropy
   Capability URLs [CAPABILITY], so that only authorized users can
   discover the proxy service.

5.2.  Clients

   Clients that support both classic HTTP CONNECT proxies and template-
   driven TCP proxies MAY accept both types via a single configuration
   string.  If the configuration string can be parsed as a URI Template
   containing the required variables, it is a template-driven TCP proxy.
   Otherwise, it is presumed to represent a classic HTTP CONNECT proxy.

   In some cases, it is valuable to allow "connect-tcp" clients to reach
   "connect-tcp"-only proxies when using a legacy configuration method
   that cannot convey a URI Template.  To support this arrangement,
   clients SHOULD treat certain errors during classic HTTP CONNECT as
   indications that the proxy might only support "connect-tcp":

   *  In HTTP/1.1: the response status code is "426 (Upgrade Required)",
      with an "Upgrade: connect-tcp" response header.

   *  In any HTTP version: the response status code is "501 (Not
      Implemented)".

      -  Requires SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL to have been
         negotiated in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3.

   If the client infers that classic HTTP CONNECT is not supported, it
   SHOULD retry the request using the registered default template for
   "connect-tcp":

   https://$PROXY_HOST:$PROXY_PORT/.well-known/masque
                    /tcp/{target_host}/{target_port}/

                   Figure 3: Registered default template

   If this request succeeds, the client SHOULD record a preference for
   "connect-tcp" to avoid further retry delays.

6.  Security Considerations

   Template-driven TCP proxying is largely subject to the same security
   risks as classic HTTP CONNECT.  For example, any restrictions on
   authorized use of the proxy (see [RFC9110], Section 9.3.6) apply
   equally to both.

   A small additional risk is posed by the use of a URI Template parser
   on the client side.  The template input string could be crafted to
   exploit any vulnerabilities in the parser implementation.  Client
   implementers should apply their usual precautions for code that
   processes untrusted inputs.

7.  Operational Considerations

   Templated TCP proxies can make use of standard HTTP gateways and
   path-routing to ease implementation and allow use of shared
   infrastructure.  However, current gateways might need modifications
   to support TCP proxy services.  To be compatible, a gateway must:

   *  support Extended CONNECT (if acting as an HTTP/2 or HTTP/3
      server).

   *  support HTTP/1.1 Upgrade to "connect-tcp" (if acting as an
      HTTP/1.1 server)

      -  only after forwarding the upgrade request to the origin and
         observing a success response.

   *  forward the "connect-tcp" protocol to the origin.

   *  convert "connect-tcp" requests between all supported HTTP server
      and client versions.

   *  allow any "Proxy-Status" headers to traverse the gateway.

8.  IANA Considerations
