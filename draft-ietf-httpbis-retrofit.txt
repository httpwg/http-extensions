                  Retrofit Structured Fields for HTTP
                   draft-ietf-httpbis-retrofit-latest

Abstract

   This specification nominates a selection of existing HTTP fields
   whose values are compatible with Structured Fields syntax, so that
   they can be handled as such (subject to certain caveats).

   To accommodate some additional fields whose syntax is not compatible,
   it also defines mappings of their semantics into Structured Fields.
   It does not specify how to convey them in HTTP messages.

1.  Introduction

   Structured Field Values for HTTP [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] introduced a
   data model with associated parsing and serialization algorithms for
   use by new HTTP field values.  Fields that are defined as Structured
   Fields can bring advantages that include:

   *  Improved interoperability and security: precisely defined parsing
      and serialisation algorithms are typically not available for
      fields defined with just ABNF and/or prose.

   *  Reuse of common implementations: many parsers for other fields are
      specific to a single field or a small family of fields.

   *  Canonical form: because a deterministic serialisation algorithm is
      defined for each type, Structure Fields have a canonical
      representation.

   *  Enhanced API support: a regular data model makes it easier to
      expose field values as a native data structure in implementations.

   *  Alternative serialisations: While [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] defines a
      textual serialisation of that data model, other, more efficient
      serialisations of the underlying data model are also possible.

   However, a field needs to be defined as a Structured Field for these
   benefits to be realised.  Many existing fields are not, making up the
   bulk of header and trailer fields seen in HTTP traffic on the
   internet.

   This specification defines how a selection of existing HTTP fields
   can be handled as Structured Fields, so that these benefits can be
   realised -- thereby making them Retrofit Structured Fields.

   It does so using two techniques.  Section 2 lists compatible fields
   -- those that can be handled as if they were Structured Fields due to
   the similarity of their defined syntax to that in Structured Fields.
   Section 3 lists mapped fields -- those whose syntax needs to be
   transformed into an underlying data model which is then mapped into
   that defined by Structured Fields.

1.1.  Using Retrofit Structured Fields

   Retrofitting data structures onto existing and widely-deployed HTTP
   fields requires careful handling to assure interoperability and
   security.  This section highlights considerations for applications
   that use Retrofit Structured Fields.

   While the majority of field values seen in HTTP traffic should be
   able to be parsed or mapped successfully, some will not.  An
   application using Retrofit Structured Fields will need to define how
   unsuccessful values will be handled.

   For example, an API that exposes field values using Structured Fields
   data types might make the field value available as a string in cases
   where the field did not successfully parse or map.

   The mapped field values described in Section 3 are not compatible
   with the original syntax of their fields, and so cannot be used
   unless parties processing them have explicitly indicated their
   support for that form of the field value.  An application using
   Retrofit Structured Fields will need to define how to negotiate
   support for them.

   For example, an alternative serialization of fields that takes
   advantage of Structured Fields would need to establish an explicit
   negotiation mechanism to assure that both peers would handle that
   serialization appropriately before using it.

   See also the security considerations in Section 5.

1.2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Compatible Fields

   The HTTP fields listed in Table 1 have values that can be handled as
   Structured Field Values according to the parsing and serialisation
   algorithms in [STRUCTURED-FIELDS] corresponding to the listed top-
   level type, subject to the caveats in Section 2.1.

   The top-level types are chosen for compatibility with the defined
   syntax of the field as well as with actual internet traffic.
   However, not all instances of these fields will successfully parse as
   a Structured Field Value.  This might be because the field value is
   clearly invalid, or it might be because it is valid but not parseable
   as a Structured Field.

   An application using this specification will need to consider how to
   handle such field values.  Depending on its requirements, it might be
   advisable to reject such values, treat them as opaque strings, or
   attempt to recover a Structured Field Value from them in an ad hoc
   fashion.

                        Table 1: Compatible Fields

2.1.  Caveats

   Note the following caveats regarding compatibility:

   Parsing differences:  Some values may fail to parse as Structured
      Fields, even though they are valid according to their originally
      specified syntax.  For example, HTTP parameter names are case-
      insensitive (per Section 5.6.6 of [HTTP]), but Structured Fields
      require them to be all-lowercase.  Likewise, many Dictionary-based
      fields (e.g., Cache-Control, Expect-CT, Pragma, Prefer,
      Preference-Applied, Surrogate-Control) have case-insensitive keys.
      Similarly, the parameters rule in HTTP (see Section 5.6.6 of
      [HTTP]) allows whitespace before the ";" delimiter, but Structured
      Fields does not.  And, Section 5.6.4 of [HTTP] allows backslash-
      escaping most characters in quoted strings, whereas Structured
      Field Strings only escape "\" and DQUOTE.  The vast majority of
      fields seen in typical traffic do not exhibit these behaviors.

   Error handling:  Parsing algorithms specified (or just widely
      implemented) for current HTTP headers may differ from those in
      Structured Fields in details such as error handling.  For example,
      HTTP specifies that repeated directives in the Cache-Control
      header field have a different precedence than that assigned by a
      Dictionary structured field (which Cache-Control is mapped to).

   Token limitations:  In Structured Fields, tokens are required to
      begin with an alphabetic character or "*", whereas HTTP tokens
      allow a wider range of characters.  This prevents use of mapped
      values that begin with one of these characters.  For example,
      media types, field names, methods, range-units, character and
      transfer codings that begin with a number or special character
      other than "*" might be valid HTTP protocol elements, but will not
      be able to be represented as Structured Field Tokens.

   Integer limitations:  Structured Fields Integers can have at most 15
      digits; larger values will not be able to be represented in them.

   IPv6 Literals:  Fields whose values contain IPv6 literal addresses
      (such as CDN-Loop, Host, and Origin) are not able to be
      represented as Structured Fields Tokens, because the brackets used
      to delimit them are not allowed in Tokens.

   Empty Field Values:  Empty and whitespace-only field values are
      considered errors in Structured Fields.  For compatible fields, an
      empty field indicates that the field should be silently ignored.

   Alt-Svc:  Some ALPN tokens (e.g., h3-Q43) do not conform to key's
      syntax, and therefore cannot be represented as a Token.  Since the
      final version of HTTP/3 uses the h3 token, this shouldn't be a
      long-term issue, although future tokens may again violate this
      assumption.

   Content-Length:  Note that Content-Length is defined as a List
      because it is not uncommon for implementations to mistakenly send
      multiple values.  See Section 8.6 of [HTTP] for handling
      requirements.

   Retry-After:  Only the delta-seconds form of Retry-After can be
      represented; a Retry-After value containing a http-date will need
      to be converted into delta-seconds to be conveyed as a Structured
      Field Value.

3.  Mapped Fields

   Some HTTP field values have syntax that cannot be successfully parsed
   as Structured Field values.  Instead, it is necessary to map them
   into a Structured Field value.

   For example, the Date HTTP header field carries a date:

   Date: Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT

   Its value would be mapped to:

   @784111777

   Unlike those listed in Section 2, these representations are not
   compatible with the original fields' syntax, and MUST NOT be used
   unless they are explicitly and unambiguously supported.  For example,
   this means that sending them to a next-hop recipient in HTTP requires
   prior negotiation.  This specification does not define how to do so.

3.1.  URLs

   The field names in Table 2 have values that can be mapped into
   Structured Field values by treating the original field's value as a
   String.

                           +==================+
                           | Field Name       |
                           +==================+
                           | Content-Location |
                           +------------------+
                           | Location         |
                           +------------------+
                           | Referer          |
                           +------------------+

                           Table 2: URL Fields

   For example, this Location field:

   Location: https://example.com/foo

   would have a mapped value of:

   "https://example.com/foo"

3.2.  Dates

   The field names in Table 3 have values that can be mapped into
   Structured Field values by parsing their payload according to
   Section 5.6.7 of [HTTP] and representing the result as a Date.

                          +=====================+
                          | Field Name          |
                          +=====================+
                          | Date                |
                          +---------------------+
                          | Expires             |
                          +---------------------+
                          | If-Modified-Since   |
                          +---------------------+
                          | If-Unmodified-Since |
                          +---------------------+
                          | Last-Modified       |
                          +---------------------+

                            Table 3: Date Fields

   For example, an Expires field's value could be mapped as:

   @1659578233

3.3.  ETags

   The field value of the ETag header field can be mapped into a
   Structured Field value by representing the entity-tag as a String,
   and the weakness flag as a Boolean "w" parameter on it, where true
   indicates that the entity-tag is weak; if 0 or unset, the entity-tag
   is strong.

   For example, this ETag header field:

   ETag: W/"abcdef"

   would have a mapped value of:

   "abcdef"; w

   If-None-Match's field value can be mapped into a Structured Field
   value which is a List of the structure described above.  When a field
   value contains "*", it is represented as a Token.

   Likewise, If-Match's field value can be mapped into a Structured
   Field value in the same manner.

   For example, this If-None-Match field:

   If-None-Match: W/"abcdef", "ghijkl", *

   would have a mapped value of:

   "abcdef"; w, "ghijkl", *

3.4.  Cookies

   The field values of the Cookie and Set-Cookie fields [COOKIES] can be
   mapped into Structured Fields Lists.

   In each case, a cookie is represented as an Inner List containing two
   Items; the cookie name and value.  The cookie name is always a
   String; the cookie value is a String, unless it can be successfully
   parsed as the textual representation of another, bare Item structured
   type (e.g., Byte Sequence, Decimal, Integer, Token, or Boolean).

   Cookie attributes map to Parameters on the Inner List, with the
   parameter name being forced to lowercase.  Cookie attribute values
   are Strings unless a specific type is defined for them.  This
   specification defines types for existing cookie attributes in
   Table 4.

                   +================+=================+
                   | Parameter Name | Structured Type |
                   +================+=================+
                   | Domain         | String          |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | HttpOnly       | Boolean         |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | Expires        | Date            |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | Max-Age        | Integer         |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | Path           | String          |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | Secure         | Boolean         |
                   +----------------+-----------------+
                   | SameSite       | Token           |
                   +----------------+-----------------+

                   Table 4: Set-Cookie Parameter Types

   The Expires attribute is mapped to a Date representation of parsed-
   cookie-date (see Section 5.1.1 of [COOKIES]).

   For example, this Set-Cookie field:

   Set-Cookie: Lang=en-US; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 10:18:14 GMT;
                  samesite=Strict; secure

   would have a mapped value of:

   ("Lang" "en-US"); expires=@1623233894;
                  samesite=Strict; secure

   And this Cookie field:

   Cookie: SID=31d4d96e407aad42; lang=en-US

   would have a mapped value of:

   ("SID" "31d4d96e407aad42"), ("lang" "en-US")

4.  IANA Considerations

   Please add the following note to the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) Field Name Registry":

      A prefix of "*" in the Structured Type column indicates that it is
      a retrofit type (i.e., not natively Structured); see RFC nnnn.

   Then, add a new column, "Structured Type", with the values from
   Section 2 assigned to the nominated registrations, prefixing each
   with "*" to indicate that it is a retrofit type.

   Finally, add a new column to the "Cookie Attribute Registry"
   established by [COOKIES] with the title "Structured Type", using
   information from Table 4.

5.  Security Considerations

   Section 2 identifies existing HTTP fields that can be parsed and
   serialised with the algorithms defined in [STRUCTURED-FIELDS].
   Variances from existing parser behavior might be exploitable,
   particularly if they allow an attacker to target one implementation
   in a chain (e.g., an intermediary).  However, given the considerable
   variance in parsers already deployed, convergence towards a single
   parsing algorithm is likely to have a net security benefit in the
   longer term.

   Section 3 defines alternative representations of existing fields.
   Because downstream consumers might interpret the message differently
   based upon whether they recognise the alternative representation,
   implementations are prohibited from generating such values unless
   they have negotiated support for them with their peer.  This
   specification does not define such a mechanism, but any such
   definition needs to consider the implications of doing so carefully.
