1.  Introduction

   HTTP caching [HTTP-CACHING] operates at the granularity of a single
   resource; the freshness of one stored response does not affect that
   of others.  This granularity can make caching more efficient -- for
   example, when a page is composed of many assets that have different
   requirements for caching.

   However, there are also cases where the relationship between stored
   responses could be used to improve cache efficiency.

   For example, it is often necessary to invalidate a set of related
   resources.  This might be because a state-changing request has side
   effects on other resources, or it might be purely for administrative
   convenience (e.g., "invalidate this part of the site").  Grouping
   responses together provides a dedicated way to express these
   relationships, instead of relying on things like URL structure.

   In addition to sharing invalidation events, the relationships
   indicated by grouping can also be used by caches to optimise their
   operation (e.g., to inform the operation of cache eviction
   algorithms).

   Section 2 introduces a means of describing the relationships between
   stored responses in HTTP caches, by associating those responses with
   one or more groups that reflect those relationships.  It also
   describes how caches can use that information to apply invalidation
   events to members of a group.

   Section 3 introduces one new source of such events: a HTTP response
   header field that allows a state-changing response to trigger a group
   invalidation.

   These mechanisms operate within a single cache, across the stored
   responses associated with a single origin server (see Section 2.1).
   They do not address the issues of synchronising state between
   multiple caches (e.g., in a hierarchy or mesh), nor do they
   facilitate association of stored responses from disparate origins.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This specification uses the following terminology from
   [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]: List, String, Parameter.

2.  The Cache-Groups Response Header Field

   The Cache-Groups HTTP response header field is a List of Strings
   (Sections 3.1 and 3.3.3 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each member of the
   List is a value that identifies a group that the response belongs to.
   These Strings are opaque -- while they might have some meaning to the
   server that creates them, the cache does not have any insight into
   their structure or content (beyond uniquely identifying a group).

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/javascript
   Cache-Control: max-age=3600
   Cache-Groups: "scripts"

   The ordering of members is not significant.  Unrecognised Parameters
   are to be ignored.

   Implementations MUST support at least 32 groups in a field value,
   with up to at least 32 characters in each member.  Note that generic
   limitations on HTTP field lengths may constrain the size of this
   field value in practice.

2.1.  Identifying Grouped Responses

   Two responses stored in the same cache are considered to belong to
   the same group when all of the following conditions are met:

   1.  They both contain a Cache-Groups response header field that
       contains the same String (in any position in the List), when
       compared character-by-character (case sensitive).

   2.  They both share the same URI origin (per Section 4.3.1 of
       [HTTP]).

2.2.  Cache Behaviour

2.2.1.  Invalidation

   A cache that invalidates a stored response MAY invalidate any stored
   responses that share groups (per Section 2.1) with that response.
   Note that further grouped invalidations are not triggered by a
   grouped invalidation; i.e., this mechanism does not cascade.

   Cache extensions can explicitly strengthen the requirement above.
   For example, a targeted cache control header field [TARGETED] might
   specify that caches processing it are required to invalidate such
   responses.

3.  The Cache-Group-Invalidation Response Header Field

   The Cache-Group-Invalidation response header field is a List of
   Strings (Sections 3.1 and 3.3.3 of [STRUCTURED-FIELDS]).  Each member
   of the List is a value that identifies a group that the response
   invalidates, per Section 2.2.1.

   For example, following a POST request that has side effects on two
   cache groups, the corresponding response could indicate that stored
   responses associated with either or both of those groups should be
   invalidated with:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: text/html
   Cache-Group-Invalidation: "eurovision-results", "australia"

   The Cache-Group-Invalidation header field MUST be ignored on
   responses to requests that have a safe method (e.g., GET; see
   Section 9.2.1 of [HTTP]).

   A cache that receives a Cache-Group-Invalidation header field on a
   response to an unsafe request MAY invalidate any stored responses
   that share groups (per Section 2.1) with any of the listed groups.

   Cache extensions can explicitly strengthen the requirement above.
   For example, a targeted cache control header field [TARGETED] might
   specify that caches processing it are required to respect the Cache-
   Group-Invalidation signal.

   The ordering of members is not significant.  Unrecognised Parameters
   are to be ignored.

   Implementations MUST support at least 32 groups in a field value,
   with up to at least 32 characters in each member.  Note that generic
   limitations on HTTP field lengths may constrain the size of this
   field value in practice.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA should perform the following tasks:

4.1.  HTTP Field Names

   Enter the following into the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Field
   Name Registry:

   *  Field Name: Cache-Groups

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Reference: RFC nnnn

   *  Comments:

   *  Field Name: Cache-Group-Invalidation

   *  Status: permanent

   *  Reference: RFC nnnn

   *  Comments:

5.  Security Considerations

   This mechanism allows resources that share an origin to invalidate
   each other.  Because of this, origins that represent multiple parties
   (sometimes referred to as "shared hosting") might allow one party to
   group its resources with those of others, or to send signals which
   have side effects upon them.

   Shared hosts that wish to mitigate these risks can control access to
   the header fields defined in this specification.
