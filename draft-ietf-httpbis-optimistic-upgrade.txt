Security Considerations for Optimistic Protocol Transitions in HTTP/1.1
              draft-ietf-httpbis-optimistic-upgrade-latest

Abstract

   In HTTP/1.1, the client can request a change to a new protocol on the
   existing connection.  This document discusses the security
   considerations that apply to data sent by the client before this
   request is confirmed, and updates RFC 9298 to avoid related security
   issues.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Background

   In HTTP/1.1, a single connection is often used for many requests, one
   after another.  After each request, the connection is returned to its
   initial state, ready to send more HTTP requests.  However, HTTP/1.1
   also contains two mechanisms that allow the client to change the
   protocol used for the remainder of the connection.

   One such mechanism is the "Upgrade" request header field ([RFC9110],
   Section 7.8), which indicates that the client would like to use this
   connection for a protocol other than HTTP/1.1.  The server replies
   with a "101 (Switching Protocols)" status code if it accepts the
   protocol change.

   The other mechanism is the HTTP "CONNECT" method.  This method
   indicates that the client wishes to establish a TCP connection to the
   specified host and port.  The server replies with a 2xx (Successful)
   response to indicate that the request was accepted and a TCP
   connection was established.  After this point, the TCP connection is
   acting as a TCP tunnel, not an HTTP/1.1 connection.

   Both of these mechanisms also permit the server to reject the
   request.  For example, [RFC9110] says:

      A server MAY ignore a received Upgrade header field if it wishes
      to continue using the current protocol on that connection.

   and

      A server MUST reject a CONNECT request that targets an empty or
      invalid port number, typically by responding with a 400 (Bad
      Request) status code.

   Rejections are common, and can happen for a variety of reasons.  An
   "upgrade" request might be rejected if:

   *  The server does not support any of the client's indicated Upgrade
      Tokens (i.e., the client's proposed new protocols), so it
      continues to use HTTP/1.1.

   *  The server knows that an upgrade to the offered protocol will not
      provide any improvement over HTTP/1.1 for this request to this
      resource, so it chooses to respond in HTTP/1.1.

   *  The server requires the client to authenticate before upgrading
      the protocol, so it replies with the status code "401
      (Authentication Required)" and provides a challenge in an
      "Authorization" response header ([RFC9110], Section 11.6.2).

   *  The resource has moved, so the server replies with a 3XX redirect
      status code ([RFC9110], Section 3.4).

   Similarly, a CONNECT request might be rejected if:

   *  The server does not support HTTP CONNECT.

   *  The specified destination is not allowed under server policy.

   *  The destination cannot be resolved, is unreachable, or does not
      accept the connection.

   *  The proxy requires the client to authenticate before proceeding.

   After rejecting a request, the server will continue to interpret
   subsequent bytes on that connection in accordance with HTTP/1.1.

   [RFC9110] also states:

      A client cannot begin using an upgraded protocol on the connection
      until it has completely sent the request message (i.e., the client
      can't change the protocol it is sending in the middle of a
      message).

   However, because of the possibility of rejection, the converse is not
   true: a client cannot necessarily begin using a new protocol merely
   because it has finished sending the corresponding request message.

   In some cases, the client might expect that the protocol transition
   will succeed.  If this expectation is correct, the client might be
   able to reduce delay by immediately sending the first bytes of the
   new protocol "optimistically", without waiting for the server's
   response.  This document explores the security implications of this
   "optimistic" behavior.

3.  Possible Security Issues

   When there are only two distinct parties involved in an HTTP/1.1
   connection (i.e., the client and the server), protocol transitions
   introduce no new security issues: each party must already be prepared
   for the other to send arbitrary data on the connection at any time.
   However, HTTP connections often involve more than two parties, if the
   requests or responses include third-party data.  For example, a
   browser (party 1) might send an HTTP request to an origin (party 2)
   with path, headers, or body controlled by a website from a different
   origin (party 3).  Post-transition protocols such as WebSocket
   similarly are often used to convey data chosen by a third party.

   If the third-party data source is untrusted, we call the data it
   provides "attacker-controlled".  The combination of attacker-
   controlled data and optimistic protocol transitions results in two
   significant security issues.

3.1.  Request Smuggling

   In a Request Smuggling attack ([RFC9112], Section 11.2) the attacker-
   controlled data is chosen in such a way that it is interpreted by the
   server as an additional HTTP request.  These attacks allow the
   attacker to speak on behalf of the client while bypassing the
   client's own rules about what requests it will issue.  Request
   Smuggling can occur if the client and server have distinct
   interpretations of the data that flows between them.

   If the server accepts a protocol transition request, it interprets
   the subsequent bytes in accordance with the new protocol.  If it
   rejects the request, it interprets those bytes as HTTP/1.1.  However,
   the client doesn't know which interpretation the server will take
   until it receives the server's response status code.  If it uses the
   new protocol optimistically, this creates a risk that the server will
   interpret attacker-controlled data in the new protocol as an
   additional HTTP request issued by the client.

   As a trivial example, consider an HTTP CONNECT client providing
   connectivity to an untrusted application.  If the client is
   authenticated to the proxy server using a connection-level
   authentication method such as TLS Client Certificates, the attacker
   could send an HTTP/1.1 POST request for the proxy server at the
   beginning of its TCP connection.  If the client delivers this data
   optimistically, and the CONNECT request fails, the server would
   misinterpret the application's data as a subsequent authenticated
   request issued by the client.

3.2.  Parser Exploits

   A related category of attacks use protocol disagreement to exploit
   vulnerabilities in the server's request parsing logic.  These attacks
   apply when the HTTP client is trusted by the server, but the post-
   transition data source is not.  If the server software was developed
   under the assumption that some or all of the HTTP request data is not
   attacker-controlled, optimistic transmission can cause this
   assumption to be violated, exposing vulnerabilities in the server's
   HTTP request parser.

4.  Operational Issues

   If the server rejects the transition request, the connection can
   continue to be used for HTTP/1.1.  There is no requirement to close
   the connection in response to a rejected transition, and keeping the
   connection open has performance advantages if additional HTTP
   requests to this server are likely.  Thus, it is normally
   inappropriate to close the connection in response to a rejected
   transition.

5.  Impact on HTTP Upgrade with Existing Upgrade Tokens

   This section describes the impact of this document's considerations
   on some registered Upgrade Tokens that are believed to be in use at
   the time of writing.

5.1.  "TLS"

   The "TLS" family of Upgrade Tokens was defined in [RFC2817], which
   correctly highlights the possibility of the server rejecting the
   upgrade.  If a client ignores this possibility and sends TLS data
   optimistically, the result cannot be valid HTTP/1.1: the first octet
   of a TLS connection must be 22 (ContentType.handshake), but this is
   not an allowed character in an HTTP/1.1 method.  A compliant HTTP/1.1
   server will treat this as a parsing error and close the connection
   without processing further requests.

5.2.  "WebSocket"/"websocket"

   Section 4.1 of [RFC6455] says:

      Once the client's opening handshake has been sent, the client MUST
      wait for a response from the server before sending any further
      data.

   Thus, optimistic use of HTTP Upgrade is already forbidden in the
   WebSocket protocol.  Additionally, the WebSocket protocol requires
   high-entropy masking of client-to-server frames (Section 5.1 of
   [RFC6455]).

5.3.  "connect-udp"

   Section 5 of [RFC9298] says:

      A client MAY optimistically start sending UDP packets in HTTP
      Datagrams before receiving the response to its UDP proxying
      request.

   However, in HTTP/1.1, this "proxying request" is an HTTP Upgrade
   request.  This upgrade is likely to be rejected in certain
   circumstances, such as when the UDP destination address (which is
   attacker-controlled) is invalid.  Additionally, the contents of the
   "connect-udp" protocol stream can include untrusted material (i.e.,
   the UDP packets, which might come from other applications on the
   client device).  This creates the possibility of Request Smuggling
   attacks.  To avoid these concerns, this text is updated as follows:

      When using HTTP/2 or later, a client MAY optimistically ...

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9298] describes the requirement for a successful
   proxy setup response, including upgrading to the "connect-udp"
   protocol, and says:

      If any of these requirements are not met, the client MUST treat
      this proxying attempt as failed and abort the connection.

   However, this could be interpreted as an instruction to abort the
   underlying TLS and TCP connections in the event of an unsuccessful
   response such as "407 ("Proxy Authentication Required)".  To avoid an
   unnecessary delay in this case, this text is hereby updated as
   follows:

      If any of these requirements are not met, the client MUST treat
      this proxying attempt as failed.  If the "Upgrade" response header
      field is absent, the client MAY reuse the connection for further
      HTTP/1.1 requests; otherwise it MUST abort the underlying
      connection.

5.4.  "connect-ip"

   The "connect-ip" Upgrade Token is defined in [RFC9484].  Section 11
   of [RFC9484] forbids clients from using optimistic upgrade, avoiding
   this issue.

6.  Guidance for Future Upgrade Tokens

   There are now several good examples of designs that reduce or
   eliminate the security concerns discussed in this document and may be
   applicable in future specifications:

   *  Forbid optimistic use of HTTP Upgrade (WebSocket, Section 4.1 of
      [RFC6455]).

   *  Embed a fixed preamble that terminates HTTP/1.1 processing
      (HTTP/2, Section 3.4 of [RFC9113]).

   *  Apply high-entropy masking of client-to-server data (WebSocket,
      Section 5.1 of [RFC6455]).

   Future specifications for Upgrade Tokens should account for the
   security issues discussed here and provide clear guidance on how
   implementations can avoid them.

6.1.  Selection of Request Methods

   Some Upgrade Tokens, such as "TLS", are defined for use with any
   ordinary HTTP Method.  The upgraded protocol continues to provide
   HTTP semantics, and will convey the response to this HTTP request.

   The other Upgrade Tokens mentioned in Section 5 do not preserve HTTP
   semantics, so the method is not relevant.  All of these Upgrade
   Tokens are specified only for use with the "GET" method.

   Future specifications for Upgrade Tokens should restrict their use to
   "GET" requests if the HTTP method is otherwise irrelevant and a
   request body is not required.  This improves consistency with other
   Upgrade Tokens and reduces the likelihood that a faulty server
   implementation might process the request body as the new protocol.

7.  Guidance for HTTP CONNECT

   In HTTP/1.1, proxy clients that send CONNECT requests on behalf of
   untrusted TCP clients MUST wait for a 2xx (Successful) response
   before forwarding any TCP payload data.  Proxy clients that start
   forwarding before confirming the response status code are vulnerable
   to a trivial request smuggling attack (Section 3.1).

   To mitigate the impact of such vulnerable clients, proxy servers MAY
   close the underlying connection when rejecting an HTTP/1.1 CONNECT
   request, without processing any further data on that connection.
   Note that this behavior will frequently impair the performance of
   correctly implemented clients, especially when returning a "407
   (Proxy Authentication Required)" response.  This performance loss can
   be be avoided by using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3, which are not vulnerable to
   this attack.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
