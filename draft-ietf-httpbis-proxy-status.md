# Introduction

HTTP intermediaries -- including both forward proxies and gateways (also known as "reverse
proxies") -- have become an increasingly significant part of HTTP deployments. In particular,
reverse proxies and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) form part of the critical infrastructure of
many Web sites.

Typically, HTTP intermediaries forward requests towards the origin server and then forward their responses back to clients. However, if an error occurs, the response is generated by the intermediary itself.

HTTP accommodates these types of errors with a few status codes; for example, 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout. However, experience has shown that more information is necessary to aid debugging and communicate what's happened to the client.

To address this, {{header}} defines a new HTTP response header field to convey such information, using the Proxy Status Types defined in {{types}}. {{register}} explains how to define new Proxy Status Types.


## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.

This specification uses Structured Headers {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} to specify syntax. The terms sh-param-list, sh-item, sh-string, sh-token and sh-integer refer to the structured types defined therein.

Note that in this specification, "proxy" is used to indicate both forward and reverse proxies, otherwise known as gateways. "Next hop" indicates the connection in the direction leading to the origin server for the request.


# The Proxy-Status HTTP Header Field {#header}

The Proxy-Status HTTP response header field allows an intermediary to indicate the nature and details of an error condition it encounters when servicing a request.

It is a Structured Headers {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} Parameterised List, where each item in the list indicates an error condition. Typically, it will have only one param-item (the error condition that triggered generation of the response it occurs within), but more than one value is not prohibited.

Each param-item's primary-id is a Proxy Status Type, a registered value that indicates the nature of the error.

Each param-item can have zero to many parameters. {{params}} lists parameters that can be used with all Proxy Status Types; individual types can define additional parameters to use with them. All parameters are optional; see {{security}} for their potential security impact.

For example:

~~~ example
HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
Proxy-Status: connection_timeout; proxy=SomeCDN; origin=abc; tries=3
~~~

indicates the specific nature of the timeout as a connect timeout to the origin with the identifier "abc", and that is was generated by the intermediary that identifies itself as "SomeCDN." Furthermore, three connection attempts were made.

Or:

~~~ example
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Proxy-Status: http_request_error; proxy=SomeReverseProxy
~~~

indicates that this 429 Too Many Requests response was generated by the intermediary, not the origin.

Each Proxy Status Type has a Recommended HTTP Status Code. When generating a HTTP response containing Proxy-Status, its HTTP status code SHOULD be set to the Recommended HTTP Status Code. However, there may be circumstances (e.g., for backwards compatibility with previous behaviours) when another status code might be used.

{{types}} lists the Proxy Status Types defined in this document; new ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in {{register}}.

Proxy-Status MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but -- as with all trailers -- it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent, this SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in headers. For example, if an intermediary is streaming a response and the upstream connection suddenly terminates, Proxy-Status can be appended to the trailers of the outgoing message (since the headers have already been sent).

Note that there are various security considerations for intermediaries using the Proxy-Status header field; see {{security}}.

Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Status header field.


## Generic Proxy Status Parameters {#params}

This section lists parameters that are potentially applicable to most Proxy Status Types.

* node - a sh-string identifying the intermediary generating this Proxy Status Type. MAY be a hostname, IP address, or alias.
* origin - a sh-string identifying the origin server whose behaviour triggered this response. MAY be a hostname, IP address, or alias.
* protocol - a sh-token indicating the ALPN protocol identifier {{!RFC7301}} used to connect to the next hop. This is only applicable when that connection was actually established.
* tries - a sh-integer indicating the number of times that the indicated error occurred when attempting to satisfy the request.
* details - a sh-string containing additional information not captured anywhere else. This can include implementation-specific or deployment-specific information.

# Defining New Proxy Status Types {#register}

New Proxy Status Types can be defined by registering them in the HTTP Proxy Status Types registry.

Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated Expert, as per {{!RFC8126}}, Section 4.5. A specification document is appreciated, but not required.

The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating requests:

* Community feedback
* If the value is sufficiently well-defined
* If the value is generic; vendor-specific, application-specific and deployment-specific values are discouraged

Registration requests should use the following template:

* Name: \[a name for the Proxy Status Type that is allowable as a sh-param-list key\]
* Description: \[a description of the conditions that generate the Proxy Status Types\]
* Extra Parameters: \[zero or more optional parameters, typed using one of the types available in sh-item\]
* Recommended HTTP status code: \[the appropriate HTTP status code for this entry\]

See the registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses> for details on where to send registration requests.


# IANA Considerations

Upon publication, please create the HTTP Proxy Status Types registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses> and populate it with the types defined in {{types}}; see {{register}} for its associated procedures.


# Security Considerations {#security}

One of the primary security concerns when using Proxy-Status is leaking information that might aid an attacker.

As a result, care needs to be taken when deciding to generate a Proxy-Status header. Note that intermediaries are not required to generate a Proxy-Status header field in any response, and can conditionally generate them based upon request attributes (e.g., authentication tokens, IP address).

Likewise, generation of all parameters is optional.

Special care needs to be taken in generating proxy and origin parameters, as they can expose information about the intermediary's configuration and back-end topology.
