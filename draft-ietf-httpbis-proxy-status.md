# Introduction

HTTP intermediaries -- including both forward proxies and gateways (also known as "reverse
proxies") -- have become an increasingly significant part of HTTP deployments. In particular,
reverse proxies and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) form part of the critical infrastructure of
many Web sites.

Typically, HTTP intermediaries forward requests towards the origin server and then forward their responses back to clients. However, if an error occurs before a response is obtained from upstream, the response is generated by the intermediary itself.

HTTP accommodates these types of errors with a few status codes; for example, 502 Bad Gateway and 504 Gateway Timeout. However, experience has shown that more information is necessary to aid debugging and communicate what's happened to the client.

Additionally, intermediaries sometimes want to convey additional information about their handling of a response, even if they did not generate it.

To enable these uses, {{header}} defines a new HTTP response field to allow intermediaries to convey details of their handling of a response, {{params}} enumerates the kind of information that can be conveyed, and {{error-types}} defines a set of error types for use when a proxy generates the response.


## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.

This specification uses Structured Headers {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}} to specify syntax. The terms sf-list, sf-item, sf-string, sf-token, sf-integer and key refer to the structured types defined therein.

Note that in this specification, "proxy" is used to indicate both forward and reverse proxies, otherwise known as gateways. "Next hop" indicates the connection in the direction leading to the origin server for the request.


# The Proxy-Status HTTP Field {#header}

The Proxy-Status HTTP response field allows an intermediary to convey additional information about its handling of a response and its associated request.

It is a List {{!I-D.ietf-httpbis-header-structure}}:

~~~ abnf
Proxy-Status   = sf-list
~~~

Each member of the list represents an intermediary that has handled the response. The first member of the list represents the intermediary closest to the origin server, and the last member of the list represents the intermediary closest to the user agent.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Proxy-Status: FooProxy, ExampleCDN
~~~

indicates that this response was handled first by FooProxy and then ExampleCDN.

Intermediaries determine when it is appropriate to add the Proxy-Status field to a response. Some might decide to add it to all responses, whereas others might only do so when specifically configured to, or when the request contains a header that activates a debugging mode.

The list members identify the intermediary that inserted the value, and MUST have a type of either sf-string or sf-token. Depending on the deployment, this might be a product or service name (e.g., ExampleProxy or "Example CDN"), a hostname ("proxy-3.example.com"), and IP address, or a generated string.

Parameters on each member convey additional information about that intermediary's handling of the response; see {{params}} for defined parameters. While all of these parameters are OPTIONAL, intermediaries are encouraged to provide as much information as possible.

When adding a value to the Proxy-Status field, intermediaries SHOULD preserve the existing contents of the field, to allow debugging of the entire chain of intermediaries handling the request.

Proxy-Status MAY be sent in HTTP trailers, but -- as with all trailers -- it might be silently discarded along the path to the user agent, so this SHOULD NOT be done unless it is not possible to send it in headers. For example, if an intermediary is streaming a response and the upstream connection suddenly terminates, Proxy-Status can be appended to the trailers of the outgoing message (since the headers have already been sent).

Note that there are various security considerations for intermediaries using the Proxy-Status field; see {{security}}.

Origin servers MUST NOT generate the Proxy-Status field.


## Proxy-Status Parameters {#params}

This section lists parameters that can be used on the members of Proxy-Status.

### next-hop

The `next-hop` parameter's value is a sf-string or sf-token that identifies the intermediary or origin server selected (and used, if contacted) for this response. Its contents might be a hostname, IP address, or alias.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Proxy-Status: cdn.example.org; next-hop=backend.example.org
~~~

### next-protocol

The `next-protocol` parameter's value indicates the ALPN protocol identifier {{!RFC7301}} used by the intermediary to connect to the next hop. This is only applicable when that connection was actually established.

The value MUST be either a sf-token or sf-binary. If the protocol identifier is able to be expressed as a sf-token using UTF-8 encoding, that form MUST be used.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Proxy-Status: "proxy.example.org"; next-protocol=h2
~~~

### error

The `error` parameter's value is a sf-token that is a Proxy Error Type. When present, it indicates that the response was generated by the proxy, not the origin server or any other upstream server.

{{error-types}} lists the Proxy Error Types defined in this document; new ones can be defined using the procedure outlined in {{register-error}}.

For example:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 504 Gateway Timeout
Proxy-Status: SomeCDN; error=connection_timeout
~~~

indicates that this 504 response was generated by SomeCDN, due to a connection timeout when going forward.

Or:

~~~ http-message
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Proxy-Status: SomeReverseProxy; error=http_request_error
~~~

indicates that this 429 Too Many Requests response was generated by the intermediary, not the origin.

When sending the error parameter, the most specific Proxy Error Type SHOULD be sent, provided that it accurately represents the error condition. If an appropriate Proxy Error Type is not defined, there are a number of generic error types (e.g., proxy_internal_error, http_protocol_error) that can be used. If they are not suitable, consider registering a new Proxy Error Type (see {{register-error}}).

Each Proxy Error Type has a Recommended HTTP Status Code. When generating a HTTP response containing `error`, its HTTP status code SHOULD be set to the Recommended HTTP Status Code. However, there may be circumstances (e.g., for backwards compatibility with previous behaviours) when another status code might be used.

### details

The `details` parameter's value is a sf-string containing additional information not captured anywhere else. This can include implementation-specific or deployment-specific information.

For example:

~~~ http-message
Proxy-Status: ExampleProxy; error="http_protocol_error";
              details="Malformed response header - space before colon"
~~~


## Defining New Proxy-Status Parameters {#register-param}

New Proxy-Status Parameters can be defined by registering them in the HTTP Proxy-Status Parameters registry.

Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated Expert, as per {{!RFC8126}}, Section 4.5. A specification document is appreciated, but not required.

The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating requests:

* Community feedback
* If the value is sufficiently well-defined
* Generic parameters are preferred over vendor-specific, application-specific or deployment-specific values. If a generic value cannot be agreed upon in the community, the parameter's name should be correspondingly specific (e.g., with a prefix that identifies the vendor, application or deployment).

Registration requests should use the following template:

* Name: \[a name for the Proxy-Status Parameter that matches key\]
* Description: \[a description of the parameter semantics and value\]
* Reference: \[to a specification defining this parameter\]

See the registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-status> for details on where to send registration requests.


## Proxy Error Types {#error-types}

This section lists the Proxy Error Types defined by this document. See {{register-error}} for information about defining new Proxy Error Types.

## Defining New Proxy Error Types {#register-error}

New Proxy Error Types can be defined by registering them in the HTTP Proxy Error Types registry.

Registration requests are reviewed and approved by a Designated Expert, as per {{!RFC8126}}, Section 4.5. A specification document is appreciated, but not required.

The Expert(s) should consider the following factors when evaluating requests:

* Community feedback
* If the value is sufficiently well-defined
* Generic types are preferred over vendor-specific, application-specific or deployment-specific values. If a generic value cannot be agreed upon in the community, the types's name should be correspondingly specific (e.g., with a prefix that identifies the vendor, application or deployment).


Registration requests should use the following template:

* Name: \[a name for the Proxy Error Type that matches sf-token\]
* Description: \[a description of the conditions that generate the Proxy Error Type\]
* Extra Parameters: \[zero or more optional parameters, along with their allowable type(s)\]
* Recommended HTTP status code: \[the appropriate HTTP status code for this entry\]

See the registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-status> for details on where to send registration requests.


# IANA Considerations

Upon publication, please create the HTTP Proxy-Status Parameters registry and the HTTP Proxy Error Types registry at <https://iana.org/assignments/http-proxy-statuses> and populate them with the types defined in {{params}} and {{error-types}} respectively; see {{register-param}} and {{register-error}} for its associated procedures.


# Security Considerations {#security}

One of the primary security concerns when using Proxy-Status is leaking information that might aid an attacker. For example, information about the intermediary's configuration and back-end topology can be exposed.

As a result, care needs to be taken when deciding to generate a Proxy-Status field. Note that intermediaries are not required to generate a Proxy-Status field in any response, and can conditionally generate them based upon request attributes (e.g., authentication tokens, IP address).

Likewise, generation of all parameters is optional.
