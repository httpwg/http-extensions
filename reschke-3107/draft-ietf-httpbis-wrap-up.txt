                        The HTTP Wrap Up Capsule
                   draft-ietf-httpbis-wrap-up-latest

Abstract

   HTTP intermediaries sometimes need to terminate long-lived request
   streams in order to facilitate load balancing or impose data limits.
   However, Web browsers commonly cannot retry failed proxied requests
   when they cannot ascertain whether an in-progress request was acted
   on.  To avoid user-visible failures, it is best for the intermediary
   to inform the client of upcoming request stream terminations in
   advance of the actual termination so that the client can wrap up
   existing operations related to that stream and start sending new work
   to a different stream or connection.  This document specifies a new
   "WRAP_UP" capsule that allows a proxy to instruct a client that it
   should not start new requests on a tunneled connection, while still
   allowing it to finish existing requests.

1.  Introduction

   [HTTP/1.1], [HTTP/2] and [HTTP/3] all have the notion of persistent
   connections, where a single connection can carry multiple request and
   response messages.  While it is expected that the connection
   persists, there are situations where a client or server may wish to
   terminate the connection gracefully.

   An HTTP/1.1 connection can be terminated by using a Connection header
   field with the close option; see Section 9.6 of [HTTP/1.1].  When a
   connection has short-lived requests/responses, this mechanism allows
   timely and non-disruptive connection termination.  However, when
   requests/responses are longer lived, the opportunity to use headers
   happens less frequently (or not at all).  There is no way for client
   or server to signal a future intent to terminate the connection.
   Instead, an abrupt termination, realized via a transport-layer close
   or reset, is required, which is potentially disruptive and can lead
   to truncated content.

   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support request multiplexing, making header-based
   connection lifecycle control impractical.  Connection headers are
   prohibited entirely.  Instead, a shutdown process using the GOAWAY
   frame is defined (see Section 6.8 of [HTTP/2] and Section 5.2 of
   [HTTP/3]).  GOAWAY signals a future intent to terminate the
   connection, supporting cases such as scheduled maintenance.  Active
   requests/responses can continue to run, while new requests need to be
   sent on a new HTTP connection.  Endpoints that use GOAWAY typically
   have a grace period in which requests/responses can run naturally to
   completion.  If they run longer than the grace period, they are
   abruptly terminated when the transport layer is closed or reset,
   which is potentially disruptive and can lead to truncated content.

1.1.  The Need for a Request Termination Intent Signal

   Intermediaries (see Section 3.7 of [HTTP]) can provide a variety of
   benefits to HTTP systems, such as load balancing, caching, and
   privacy improvements.  Deployments of intermediaries also need to be
   maintained, which can sometimes require taking intermediaries
   temporarily offline.  For example, if a gateway has a client HTTP/2
   connection and needs to go down for maintenance, it can send a GOAWAY
   to stop the client issuing requests that would be forwarded to the
   origin.

   +--------+      +---------+      +--------+
   | Client |      | Gateway |      | Origin |
   |        |      |       * |      |      * |
   |        +======+ GOAWAY| +~~~~~~+      | |
   |      <----------------+               | |
   |                         HTTP Responses| |
   |      <--------------------------------+ |
   |        +======+         +~~~~~~+        |
   +--------+  ^   +---------+   ^  +--------+
               |                 |
        TLS --'                   '-- TLS

                       Figure 1: Gateway Sends GOAWAY

   The connection close details described above apply to an
   intermediary's upstream and downstream connections.  Since a proxy
   can do request aggregation or fan out, there is no guarantee of a 1:1
   ratio of upstream/downstream.  As such, the lifetimes of these
   connections are not coupled tightly.  For example, a gateway can
   terminate a client HTTP/2 connections and map individual requests to
   an origin HTTP/1.1 connection pool.  If any single origin connection
   indicates an intent to close, it doesn't make sense for the gateway
   to issue a GOAWAY to the client, or to respond to a client GOAWAY by
   closing connections in the pool.

   Long-lived requests pose a problem for maintenance, especially for
   HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, and even more so for intermediaries.  Sometimes
   they need to terminate individual request streams in order to
   facilitate load balancing or impose data limits, while leaving the
   connection still active.  GOAWAY is not suitable for this task.

   Some applications using HTTP have their own control plane running
   over HTTP, that could be used for a graceful termination.  For
   example, WebSockets has separate control and data frames.  The Close
   frame (Section 5.5.1 of [WEBSOCKET]) is used for the WebSocket close
   sequence.  However, in the maintenance scenario, an intermediary that
   is not WebSocket aware cannot use the formal sequence.  Nor is there
   any standard for it to signal to the endpoints to initiate that
   sequence.  Some intermediaries are WebSocket aware, and in theory
   could send Close frames.  However, there can be other considerations
   that prevent this working effectively in real deployments, since the
   intermediary is a generic proxy that may invalidate endpoint
   expectations.

   Many long-lived HTTP request types do not have control messages that
   could signal an intent to terminate the request.  For example, see
   CONNECT (Section 9.3.6 of [HTTP]) or connect-udp ({?CONNECT-
   UDP=RFC9298}}).  In these models, the client requests that a proxy
   create a tunnel to a target origin.  On success, the newly
   established tunnel is used as the underlying transport to then
   establish a second HTTP connection directly to the origin.  In that
   situation, the proxy cannot inspect the contents of the tunnel, nor
   inject any data into it; the proxy only sees a single long-lived
   request.  The proxy is responsible for managing the lifetime of the
   tunnel, but can only terminate it abortively.  Such abrupt
   termination can lead to truncated content, which the client cannot
   safely request again.  This is especially disruptive if the tunnelled
   HTTP connection has many active requests.  Web browsers, for example,
   commonly cannot retry failed proxied requests when they cannot
   ascertain whether an in-progress request was acted on.

   To avoid user-visible failures, it is best for the proxy to inform
   the client of upcoming request stream terminations in advance of the
   actual termination.  This allows the client to wrap up existing
   operations related to that stream and start sending new work to a
   different stream or connection.

                       Figure 2: Proxy Sends WRAP_UP

   This document specifies a new "WRAP_UP" capsule (see Section 3 of
   [HTTP-DGRAM]), which a server can send on an HTTP Data Stream, to
   inform a client that it intends to close the stream.

   An HTTP proxy can send a WRAP_UP capsule to instruct a client that it
   should not start new requests on a tunneled connection, while still
   allowing it to finish existing requests.

1.3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms "connection", "client", and "server"
   from Section 3.3 of [HTTP] and the terms "intermediary", "proxy", and
   "gateway" from Section 3.7 of [HTTP].

2.  Mechanism

   This document defines the "WRAP_UP" capsule (see Section 4 for the
   value).  The WRAP_UP capsule allows a proxy to indicate to a client
   that it wishes to close the request stream that the capsule was sent
   on.  The WRAP_UP capsule has no Capsule Value.

2.1.  Proxy Behavior

   Proxies often know in advance that they will close a request stream.
   This can be due to maintenance of the proxy itself, load balancing,
   or applying data usage limits on a particular stream.  When a proxy
   has advance notice that it will soon close a request stream, it MAY
   send a WRAP_UP capsule to share that information with the client.
   This can also be used when the proxy wishes to release resources
   associated with a request stream, such as HTTP Datagrams (see
   Section 2 of [HTTP-DGRAM]) or WebTransport streams (see
   [WEBTRANSPORT]).

2.2.  Client Handling

   When a client receives a WRAP_UP capsule on a request stream, it
   SHOULD try to wrap up its use of that stream.  For example, if the
   stream carried a connect-udp request and is used as the underlying
   transport for an HTTP/3 connection, then after receiving a WRAP_UP
   capsule the client SHOULD NOT send any new requests on the proxied
   HTTP/3 connection - but existing in-progress proxied requests are not
   affected by the WRAP_UP capsule.

2.3.  Minutiae

   Clients MUST NOT send the WRAP_UP capsule.  If a server receives a
   WRAP_UP capsule, it MUST abort the corresponding request stream.
   Endpoints MUST NOT send the WRAP_UP capsule with a non-zero Capsule
   Length.  If an endpoint receives a WRAP_UP capsule with a non-zero
   Capsule Length, it MUST abort the corresponding request stream.
   Proxies MUST NOT send more than one WRAP_UP capsule on a given
   stream.  If a client receives a second WRAP_UP capsule on a given
   request stream, it MUST abort the stream.  Endpoints that abort the
   request stream due to an unexpected or malformed WRAP_UP capsule MUST
   follow the error-handling procedure defined in Section 3.3 of
   [HTTP-DGRAM].

3.  Security Considerations

   While it might be tempting for clients to implement the WRAP_UP
   capsule by treating it as if they had received a GOAWAY inside the
   encryption of the end-to-end connection, doing so has security
   implications.  GOAWAY carries semantics around which requests have
   been acted on, and those can have security implications.  Since
   WRAP_UP is sent by a proxy outside of the end-to-end encryption, it
   cannot be trusted to ascertain whether any requests were handled by
   the origin.  Because of this, client implementations can only use
   receipt of WRAP_UP as a hint and MUST NOT use it to make
   determinations on whether any requests were handled by the origin or
   not.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document (if approved) will request IANA to add the following
   entry to the "HTTP Capsule Types" registry maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/masque>.

   Value:  0x272DDA5E (will be changed to a lower value if this document
      is approved)
   Capsule Type:  WRAP_UP
   Status:  provisional (will be permanent if this document is approved)
