--- abstract

The 'Key' header field for HTTP responses allows an origin server to describe the secondary cache
key (RFC 7234, Section 4.1) for a resource, by conveying what is effectively a short algorithm
that can be used upon later requests to determine if a stored response is reusable for a given
request.

Key has the advantage of avoiding an additional round trip for validation whenever a new request
differs slightly, but not significantly, from prior requests.

Key also informs user agents of the request characteristics that might result in different content,
which can be useful if the user agent is not sending request header fields in order to reduce the
risk of fingerprinting.

# Introduction

In HTTP caching {{RFC7234}}, the Vary response header field effectively modifies the key used to
store and access a response to include information from the request's headers. This "secondary
cache key" allows proactive content negotiation {{RFC7231}} to work with caches.

Vary's operation is generic; it works well when caches understand the semantics of the selecting
headers. For example, the Accept-Language request header field has a well-defined syntax for
expressing the client's preferences; a cache that understands this header field can select the
appropriate response (based upon its Content-Language header field) and serve it to a client,
without any knowledge of the underlying resource.

Vary does not work as well when the criteria for selecting a response are specific to the resource.
For example, if the nature of the response depends upon the presence or absence of a particular
Cookie ({{RFC6265}}) in a request, Vary doesn't have a mechanism to offer enough fine-grained,
resource-specific information to aid a cache's selection of the appropriate response.

Additionally, when new selecting headers are defined, caches need to be updated to understand their
semantics before Vary can operate over them efficiently; due to the sometimes slow rate of cache
deployment, this can be problematic.

Finally, Vary has proven to be difficult to implement correctly and efficiently by high-performance
intermediary caches, because doing so involves examining all cached responses with the request's
URL.

This document defines a new response header field, "Key", that allows resources to describe the
secondary cache key in a fine-grained, resource-specific manner, leading to improved cache
efficiency when responses depend upon such headers.


## Examples

For example, this response header field:

~~~ example
  Key: cookie;param=_sess;param=ID
~~~

indicates that the selected response depends upon the "_sess" and "ID" cookie values.

This Key:

~~~ example
  Key: user-agent;substr=MSIE
~~~

indicates that there are two possible secondary cache keys for this resource; one for requests
whose User-Agent header field contains "MSIE", and another for those that don't.

A more complex example:

~~~ example
  Key: user-agent;substr=MSIE;Substr="mobile", Cookie;param="ID"
~~~

indicates that the selected response depends on the presence of two strings in the User-Agent
request header field, as well as the value of the "ID" cookie request header field.


## Notational Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
{{RFC2119}}.

This document uses the Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) notation of {{RFC5234}} (including the
DQUOTE rule), and the list rule extension defined in {{RFC7230}}, Section 7. It includes by
reference the field-name, quoted-string and quoted-pair rules from that document, the OWS rule from
{{RFC7230}} and the parameter rule from {{RFC7231}}.


# The "Key" Response Header Field

The "Key" response header field describes the portions of the request that the resource currently
uses to select representations.

As such, its semantics are similar to the "Vary" response header field, but it allows more
fine-grained description, using "key parameters".

Caches can use this information as part of determining whether a stored response can be used to
satisfy a given request. When a cache knows and fully understands the Key header field for a given
resource, it MAY ignore the Vary response header field in any stored responses for it.

Additionally, user agents can use Key to discover if additional request header fields might
influence the resource's selection of responses.

The Key field-value is a comma-delimited list of selecting header fields (similar to Vary), with
zero to many parameters each, delimited by semicolons.

~~~ abnf7230
  Key       = 1#key-value
  key-value = field-name *( OWS ";" OWS parameter )
~~~

Note that, as per {{RFC7231}}, parameter names are case-insensitive, and parameter values can be
double-quoted strings (potentially with "\\"-escaped characters inside).

The following header fields have the same effect:

~~~ example
  Vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie
  Key: Accept-Encoding, Cookie
~~~

However, Key's use of parameters allows:

~~~ example
  Key: Accept-Encoding, Cookie; param=foo
~~~

to indicate that the secondary cache key depends upon the Accept-Encoding header field and the
"foo" Cookie.

One important difference between Vary and Key is how they are applied. Vary is specified to be
specific to the response it occurs within, whereas Key is specific to the resource (as identified
by the request URL) it is associated with. The most recent key you receive for a given resource is
applicable to all responses from that resource.

This difference allows more efficient implementation (and reflects practices that many caches use
in implementing Vary already).

This specification defines a selection of Key parameters to address common use cases such as
selection upon individual Cookie header fields, User-Agent substrings and numerical ranges. Future
parameters may define further capabilities.


## Relationship with Vary

Origin servers SHOULD still send Vary when using Key, to ensure backwards compatibility.

For example,

~~~ example
  Vary: User-Agent
  Key: User-Agent;substr="mozilla"
~~~

Note that, in some cases, it may be better to explicitly use "Vary: *" if clients and caches don't have any practical way to use the Vary header field's value. For example,

~~~ example
  Vary: *
  Key: Cookie;param="ID"
~~~

Except when Vary: * is used, the set of headers used in Key SHOULD reflect the same request header fields as Vary does, even if they don't have parameters. For example,

~~~ example
  Vary: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent
  Key: Accept-Encoding, User-Agent;substr="mozilla"
~~~

Here, Accept-Encoding is included in Key without parameters; caches MAY treat these as they do
values in the Vary header, relying upon knowledge of their generic semantics to select an
appropriate response.


## Calculating a Secondary Cache Key

When used by a cache to determine whether a stored response can be used to satisfy a presented
request, each field-name in Key identifies a potential request header, just as with the Vary
response header field.

However, each of these can have zero to many key parameters that change how the response selection
process (as defined in {{RFC7234}}, Section 4.3) works.

In particular, when a cache fully implements this specification, it creates a secondary cache key
for every request by following the instructions in the Key header field, ignoring the Vary header
for this purpose.

Then, when a new request is presented, the secondary cache key generated for that request can be
compared to the stored one to find the appropriate response, to determine if it can be selected.

To generate a secondary cache key for a given request (including that which is stored with a
response) using Key, the following steps are taken:

{: style="format %d)"  counter="a"}
1. If the Key header field is not present on the most recent cacheable (as per {{RFC7234}}, Section 3)) response seen for the resource, abort this algorithm (i.e., fall back to using Vary to determine the secondary cache key).
2. Let `key_value` be the result of Creating a Header Field Value ({{value}}) with `key` as the `target_field_name` and the most recently seen response header list for the resource as `header_list`.
3. Let `secondary_key` be an empty string.
4. Create `key_list` by splitting `key_value` on "," characters, excepting "," characters within quoted strings, as per {{RFC7230}}, Section 3.2.6.
5. For `key_item` in `key_list`:

   {: style="format %d)" counter="b"}
   1. Remove any leading and trailing WSP from `key_item`.
   2. If `key_item` does not contain a ";" character, fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}) and skip to the next `key_item`.
   3. Let `field_name` be the string before the first ";" character in `key_item`, removing any WSP between them.
   4. Let `field_value` be the result of Creating a Header Field Value ({{value}}) with `field_name` as the `target_field_name` and the request header list as `header_list`.
   5. Let `parameters` be the string after the first ";" character in `key_item`, removing any WSP between them.
   6. Create `param_list` by splitting `parameters` on ";" characters, excepting ";" characters within quoted strings, as per {{RFC7230}}, Section 3.2.6.
   7. For `parameter` in `param_list`:

      {: style="format %d)"  counter="c"}
      1. If `parameter` does not contain a "=", fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}) and skip to the next `key_item`.
      2. Remove any WSP at the beginning and/or end of `parameter`.
      3. Let `param_name` be the string before the first "=" character in `parameter`, case-normalized to lowercase.
      4. If `param_name` does not identify a Key parameter processing algorithm that is implemented, fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}) and skip to the next `key_item`.
      5. Let `param_value` be the string after the first "=" character in `parameter`.
      6. If the first and last characters of `param_value` are both DQUOTE:

         {: style="format %d)" counter="d"}
         1. Remove the first and last characters of `param_value`.
         2. Replace quoted-pairs within `param_value` with the octet following the backslash, as per {{RFC7230}}, Section 3.2.6.
      7. If `param_value` does not conform to the syntax defined for it by the parameter definition, fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}) and skip to the next `key_item`.
      8. Run the identified processing algorithm on `field_value` with the `param_value`, and append the result to `secondary_key`. If parameter processing fails ({{fail-param}}), skip to the next `key_item`.
      9. Append a separator character (e.g., NULL) to `secondary_key`.
6. Return `secondary_key`.

Note that this specification does not require that exact algorithm to be implemented. However,
implementations' observable behavior MUST be identical to running it. This includes parameter
processing algorithms; implementations MAY use different internal artefacts for secondary cache
keys, as long as the results are the same.

Likewise, while the secondary cache key associated with both stored and presented requests is
required to use the most recently seen Key header field for the resource in question, this can be
achieved using a variety of implementation strategies, including (but not limited to):

* Generating a new secondary cache key for every stored response associated with the resource upon each request.
* Caching the secondary cache key with the stored request/response pair and re-generating it when the Key header field is observed to change.
* Caching the secondary cache key with the stored response and invalidating the stored response(s) when the Key header field is observed to change.


### Creating a Header Field Value {#value}

Given a header field name `target_field_name` and `header_list`, a list of (`field_name`,
`field_value`) tuples:

{: style="format %d)"  counter="e"}
1. Let `target_field_values` be an empty list.
3. For each (`field_name`, `field_value`) tuple in `header_list`:

   {: style="format %d)"  counter="f"}
   1. If `field_name` does not match `target_field_name`, skip to the next tuple.
   1. Strip leading and trailing WSP from `field_value` and append it to `target_field_values`.
4. If `target_field_values` is empty, return an empty string.
5. Return the concatenation of `target_field_values`, separating each with "," characters.


### Failing Parameter Processing {#fail-param}

In some cases, a key parameter cannot determine a secondary cache key corresponding to its
nominated header field value. When this happens, Key processing needs to fail safely, so that the
correct behavior is observed.

When this happens, implementations MUST either behave as if the whole Key header field was not
present (i.e., abort processing of Key, ignoring it entirely and falling back to Vary), or assure
that the nominated header fields being compared match, as per {{RFC7234}}, Section 4.1 (i.e., treat
the failing portion of the Key header as falling back to Vary, but continuing to process the rest).


## Key Parameters

A Key parameter associates a name with a specific processing algorithm that takes two inputs; a
HTTP header value "header_value" (as described in {{value}}), and "parameter_value", a string that
indicates how the identified header should be processed.

The set of key parameters (and their associated processing algorithms) is extensible; see {{iana}}.
This document defines the following key parameters:


### div

The "div" parameter normalizes positive integer header values into groups by dividing them by a
configured value.

Its value's syntax is:

~~~ abnf7230
div    = 1*DIGIT
~~~

To process a set of header fields against a div parameter, follow these steps (or their equivalent):

{: style="format %d)"}
1. If `parameter_value` is "0", fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}).
2. If `header_value` is the empty string, return "none".
3. If `header_value` contains a ",", remove it and all subsequent characters.
4. Remove all WSP characters from `header_value`.
5. If `header_value` does not match the div ABNF rule, fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}).
6. Return the quotient of `header_value` / `parameter_value` (omitting the modulus).

For example, the Key:

~~~ example
Key: Bar;div=5
~~~

indicates that the "Bar" header's field value should be partitioned into groups of 5. Thus, the
following field values would be considered the same (because, divided by 5, they all result in 0):

~~~ example
Bar: 1
Bar: 3 , 42
Bar: 4, 1
~~~

whereas these would be considered to be in a different group (because, divided by 5, they all result in 2);

~~~ example
Bar: 12
Bar: 10
Bar: 14, 1
~~~


### partition

The "partition" parameter normalizes positive numeric header values into pre-defined segments.

Its value's syntax is:

~~~ abnf7230
partition = [ segment ] *( ":" [ segment ] )
segment   = [ 0*DIGIT "." ] 1*DIGIT
~~~

To process a set of header fields against a partition parameter, follow these steps (or their
equivalent):

{: style="format %d)" counter="g"}
1. If `header_value` is the empty string, return "none".
2. If `header_value` contains a ",", remove it and all subsequent characters.
3. Remove all WSP characters from `header_value`.
4. If `header_value` does not match the segment ABNF rule, fail parameter processing ({{fail-param}}).
5. Let `segment_id` be 0.
6. Create a list `segment_list` by splitting `parameter_value` on ":" characters.
6. For each `segment_value` in `segment_list`:

   {: style="format %d)"  counter="h"}
   1. If `header_value` is less than `segment_value` when they are numerically compared, skip to step 7.
   2. Increment `segment_id` by 1.
7. Return `segment_id`.


For example, the Key:

~~~ example
Key: Foo;partition=20:30:40
~~~

indicates that the "Foo" header's field value should be divided into four segments:

* less than 20
* 20 to less than 30
* 30 to less than 40
* forty or greater

Thus, the following headers would all be normalized to the first segment:

~~~ example
Foo: 1
Foo: 0
Foo: 4, 54
Foo: 19.9
~~~

whereas the following would fall into the second segment:

~~~ example
Foo: 20
Foo: 29.999
Foo:  24   , 10
~~~


### match

The "match" parameter is used to determine if an exact value occurs in a list of header values. It
is case-sensitive.

Its value's syntax is:

~~~ abnf7230
match  = ( token / quoted-string )
~~~

To process a set of header fields against a match parameter, follow these steps (or their
equivalent):

{: style="format %d)" counter="i"}
1. If `header_value` is the empty string, return "none".
2. Create `header_list` by splitting `header_value` on "," characters.
3. For each `header_item` in `header_list`:

   {: style="format %d)" counter="j"}
   1. Remove leading and trailing WSP characters in `header_item`.
   2. If the value of `header_item` is character-for-character identical to `parameter_value`, return "1".
4. Return "0".

For example, the Key:

~~~ example
Key: Baz;match="charlie"
~~~

Would return "1" for the following header field values:

~~~ example
Baz: charlie
Baz: foo, charlie
Baz: bar, charlie     , abc
~~~

and "0" for these:

~~~ example
Baz: theodore
Baz: joe, sam
Baz: "charlie"
Baz: Charlie
Baz: cha rlie
Baz: charlie2
~~~


### substr

The "substr" parameter is used to determine if a value occurs as a substring of an item in a list
of header values. It is case-sensitive.

Its value's syntax is:

~~~ abnf7230
substr  = ( token / quoted-string )
~~~

To process a set of header fields against a substr parameter, follow these steps (or their
equivalent):

{: style="format %d)" counter="k"}
1. If `header_value` is the empty string, return "none".
2. Create `header_list` by splitting `header_value` on "," characters.
3. For each `header_item` in `header_list`:

   {: style="format %d)" counter="l"}
   1. Remove leading and trailing WSP characters in `header_item`.
   2. If the value of `parameter_value` is character-for-character present as a substring of `header_value`, return "1".
4. Return "0".

For example, the Key:

~~~ example
Key: Abc;substr=bennet
~~~

Would return "1" for the following header field values:

~~~ example
Abc: bennet
Abc: foo, bennet
Abc: abennet00
Abc: bar, 99bennet     , abc
Abc: "bennet"
~~~

and "0" for these:

~~~ example
Abc: theodore
Abc: joe, sam
Abc: Bennet
Abc: Ben net
~~~


### param

The "param" parameter considers the request header field as a list of key=value parameters, and
uses the nominated key's value as the secondary cache key.

Its value's syntax is:

~~~ abnf7230
param  = ( token / quoted-string )
~~~

To process a list of header fields against a param parameter, follow these steps (or their
equivalent):

{: style="format %d)" counter="m"}
1. Let `header_list` be an empty list.
2. Create `header_list_tmp1` by splitting header_value on "," characters.
3. For each `header_item_tmp1` in `header_list_tmp1`:

   {: style="format %d)" counter="n"}
   1. Create `header_list_tmp2` by splitting `header_item_tmp1` on ";" characters.
   2. For each `header_item_tmp2` in `header_list_tmp2`:

      {: style="format %d)" counter="o"}
      1. Remove leading and trailing WSP from `header_item_tmp2`.
      2. Append `header_item_tmp2` to header_list.
4. For each `header_item` in `header_list`:

   {: style="format %d)" counter="p"}
   1. If the "=" character does not occur within `header_item`, skip to the next `header_item`.
   2. Let `item_name` be the string occurring before the first "=" character in `header_item`.
   3. If `item_name` does not case-insensitively match `parameter_value`, skip to the next `header_item`.
   4. Return the string occurring after the first "=" character in `header_item`.
5. Return the empty string.

Note that steps 2 and 3 accommodate semicolon-separated values, so that it can be used with the Cookie request header field.

For example, the Key:

~~~ example
Key: Def;param=liam
~~~

The following headers would return the string (surrounded in single quotes) indicated:

~~~ example
Def: liam=123           // '123'
Def: mno=456            // ''
Def:                    // ''
Def: abc=123; liam=890  // '890'
Def: liam="678"         // '"678"'
~~~




# IANA Considerations {#iana}

This specification defines the HTTP Key Parameter Registry, maintained at
<http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-parameters/http-parameters.xhtml#key>.

## Procedure

Key Parameter registrations MUST include the following fields:

* Parameter Name: \[name\]
* Reference: \[Pointer to specification text\]

Values to be added to this namespace require IETF Review (see Section 4.1 of {{RFC5226}}) and MUST
conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section.

## Registrations

This specification makes the following entries in the HTTP Key Parameter Registry:

|----------------|---------------|
| Parameter Name | Reference     |
|----------------+---------------|
| div            | {{div}}       |
|----------------+---------------|
| partition      | {{partition}} |
|----------------+---------------|
| match          | {{match}}     |
|----------------+---------------|
| substr         | {{substr}}    |
|----------------+---------------|
| param          | {{param}}     |
|----------------|---------------|



# Security Considerations

Because Key is an alternative to Vary, it is possible for caches to behave differently based upon
whether they implement Key. Likewise, because support for any one Key parameter is not required, it
is possible for different implementations of Key to behave differently. In both cases, an attacker
might be able to exploit these differences.

This risk is mitigated by the requirement to fall back to Vary when unsupported parameters are
encountered, coupled with the requirement that servers that use Key also include a relevant Vary
header.

An attacker with the ability to inject response headers might be able to perform a cache poisoning
attack that tailors a response to a specific user (e.g., by Keying to a Cookie that's specific to
them). While the attack is still possible without Key, the ability to tailor is new.

When implemented, Key might result in a larger number of stored responses for a given resource in
caches; this, in turn, might be used to create an attack upon the cache itself. Good cache
replacement algorithms and denial of service monitoring in cache implementations are reasonable
mitigations against this risk.
