This document defines a mechanism for running the WebSocket Protocol (RFC 6455)
over a single stream of an HTTP/2 connection.

# Introduction

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) provides compatible resource-level
semantics across different versions but it does not offer
compatibility at the connection management level. Other protocols,
such as WebSockets, that rely on connection management details of HTTP
must be updated for new versions of HTTP.

The WebSocket Protocol {{!RFC6455}} uses the HTTP/1.1 {{!RFC7230}}
Upgrade mechanism to transition a TCP connection from HTTP into a
WebSocket connection. A different approach must be taken with HTTP/2
{{!RFC7540}}. HTTP/2 does not allow connection-wide header fields and status
codes such as the Upgrade and Connection request header fields or the 101
response code due to its multiplexing nature. These are all required
by the {{!RFC6455}} opening handshake.

Being able to bootstrap WebSockets from HTTP/2 allows one TCP
connection to be shared by both protocols and extends HTTP/2's
more efficient use of the network to WebSockets.

This document extends the HTTP/2 CONNECT method. The extension allows
the substitution of a new protocol name to connect to rather than the
external host normally used by CONNECT. The result is a tunnel on a
single HTTP/2 stream that can carry data for WebSockets (or any other
protocol). The other streams on the connection may carry more extended
CONNECT tunnels, traditional HTTP/2 data, or a mixture of both.

This tunneled stream will be multiplexed with other regular streams on
the connection and enjoys the normal priority, cancellation, and flow
control features of HTTP/2.

Streams that successfully establish a WebSocket connection using a
tunneled stream and the modifications to the opening handshake defined
in this document then use the traditional WebSocket Protocol, treating
the stream as if were the TCP connection in that specification.

# Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 {{!RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they
appear in all capitals, as shown here.

# The SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL SETTINGS Parameter

This document adds a new SETTINGS Parameter to those defined by
{{!RFC7540}}, Section 6.5.2.

The new parameter name is SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL. The value
of the parameter MUST be 0 or 1.

Upon receipt of SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL with a value of 1, a client
MAY use the Extended CONNECT definition of this document when creating new
streams. Receipt of this parameter by a server does not have any
impact.

A sender MUST NOT send a SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter with the
value of 0 after previously sending a value of 1.

The use of a SETTINGS Parameter to opt-in to an otherwise incompatible
protocol change is a use of "Extending HTTP/2" defined by Section 5.5
of {{!RFC7540}}. If a client were to use the provisions of the extended
CONNECT method defined in this document without first receiving a
SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL parameter, a non-supporting peer would
detect a malformed request and generate a stream error (Section
8.1.2.6 of {{!RFC7540}}).

# The Extended CONNECT Method

Usage of the CONNECT method in HTTP/2 is defined by Section 8.3 of
{{!RFC7540}}. This extension modifies the method in the following ways:

* A new pseudo-header field :protocol MAY be included on request HEADERS
  indicating the desired protocol to be spoken on the tunnel created
  by CONNECT. The pseudo-header field is single valued and contains a value
  from the HTTP Upgrade Token Registry defined by {{!RFC7230}}.

* On requests bearing the :protocol pseudo-header field, the :scheme and
  :path pseudo-header fields MUST be included.

* On requests bearing the :protocol pseudo-header field, the :authority
  pseudo-header field is interpreted according to Section 8.1.2.3
  of {{!RFC7540}} instead of Section 8.3 of {{!RFC7540}}. In particular the server
  MUST NOT make a new TCP connection to the host and port indicated by
  the :authority.

Upon receiving a CONNECT request bearing the :protocol pseudo-header field
the server establishes a tunnel to another service of the protocol
type indicated by the pseudo-header field. This service may or may not be
co-located with the server.

# Using Extended CONNECT To Bootstrap The WebSocket Protocol

The pseudo-header field :protocol MUST be included in the CONNECT request
and it MUST have a value of `websocket` to initiate a WebSocket
connection on an HTTP/2 stream. Other HTTP request and response
header fields, such as those for manipulating cookies, may be included in
the HEADERS with the CONNECT method as usual. This request replaces
the GET-based request in {{!RFC6455}} and is used to process the
WebSockets opening handshake.

The scheme of the Target URI {{!RFC7230}} MUST be `https` for `wss` schemed
WebSockets and `http` for `ws` schemed WebSockets. The websocket URI is
still used for proxy autoconfiguration.

{{!RFC6455}} requires the use of Connection and Upgrade header fields that
are not part of HTTP/2. They MUST NOT be included in the CONNECT
request defined here.

{{!RFC6455}} requires the use of a Host header field which is also not part of
HTTP/2. The Host information is conveyed as part of the :authority
pseudo-header field which is required on every HTTP/2 transaction.

Implementations using this extended CONNECT to bootstrap WebSockets do
not do the processing of the {{!RFC6455}} Sec-WebSocket-Key and
Sec-WebSocket-Accept header fields as that functionality has been superseded
by the :protocol pseudo-header field.

The Sec-WebSocket-Version, Origin {{!RFC6454}}, Sec-WebSocket-Protocol,
and Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header fields are used on the CONNECT request
and response header fields in the same way as defined in {{!RFC6455}}. Note
that HTTP/1 header names were case-insensitive and HTTP/2 requires
they be encoded as lower case.

After successfully processing the opening handshake, the peers should
proceed with The WebSocket Protocol {{!RFC6455}} using the HTTP/2
stream from the CONNECT transaction as if it were the TCP connection
referred to in {{!RFC6455}}. The state of the WebSocket connection at
this point is OPEN as defined by {{!RFC6455}}, Section 4.1.

The HTTP/2 stream closure is also analogous to the TCP connection of
{{!RFC6455}}. Orderly TCP level closures are represented as END_STREAM
({{!RFC7540}}, Section 6.1) flags and RST exceptions are represented
with the RST_STREAM ({{!RFC7540}}, Section 6.4) frame with the CANCEL
({{!RFC7540}}, Section 7) error code.

# Design Considerations

A more native integration with HTTP/2 is certainly possible with
larger additions to HTTP/2. This design was selected to minimize the
solution complexity while still addressing the primary concern of running
HTTP/2 and WebSockets concurrently.

# About Intermediaries

This document does not change how WebSockets interacts with HTTP forward
proxies. If a client wishing to speak WebSockets connects via HTTP/2
to an HTTP proxy it should continue to use a traditional (i.e. not with
a :protocol pseudo-header field) CONNECT to tunnel through that proxy to the
WebSocket server via HTTP.

The resulting version of HTTP on that tunnel determines whether
WebSockets is initiated directly or via a modified CONNECT request
described in this document.

# Security Considerations

{{!RFC6455}} ensures that non-WebSockets clients, especially
XMLHttpRequest based clients, cannot make a WebSocket connection. Its
primary mechanism for doing that is the use of Sec- prefixed request
header fields that cannot be created by XMLHttpRequest-based clients. This
specification addresses that concern in two ways:

* The CONNECT method is prohibited from being used by XMLHttpRequest

* The use of a pseudo-header field is something that is connection specific
  and HTTP/2 does not ever allow to be created outside of the protocol stack.

# IANA Considerations

This document establishes an entry for the HTTP/2 Settings Registry
that was established by Section 11.3 of {{!RFC7540}}.
