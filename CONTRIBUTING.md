## Raising Issues

We use our [issues list](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues) to track items for discussion and their resolution.

Before filing a new issue, please consider a few things:

* Issues should be just that; issues with our deliverables, not questions or
  support requests.

* Please review the issues list to make sure that you aren't filing a
  duplicate.

* If you're not sure how to phrase your issue, please ask on the [mailing list]((http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/)).

Off-topic and duplicate issues will be closed without discussion.

Issues can also be raised on the [Working Group mailing
list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/).

Note that comments on individual commits will only be responded to with best
effort, and may not be seen.


## Resolving Issues

Issues will be labeled by the Chair as either `editorial` or `design`.

* **Design** issues require discussion and consensus in the Working Group. This discussion can happen both in the issue and on the [Working Group mailing list]((http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/)). 

* **Editorial** issues can be closed by the editor(s) without consensus or notification. Typically, any discussion will take place on the issue itself.

Once the resolution for a design issue is determined, it will be recorded in the
issue and then the issue will be labelled `editor-ready`. After the editor has
incorporated a resolution into the specification, the issue can be closed.

When a new draft is published, the design issues that have been closed since
the last draft will be highlighted on the mailing list, to aid reviewers.

If substantive new information is brought to our attention, issues can be
reopened by the Chair.


## Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open
issues. In the latter case, please identify the relevant issue.

Please do not use a pull request to open a new design issue.


## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies to all Working Group communications and meetings.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](http://www.ietf.org/) intended by the Contributor
for publication as all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or RFC and any
statement made within the context of an IETF activity is considered an "IETF
Contribution". Such statements include oral statements in IETF sessions, as
well as written and electronic communications made at any time or place, which
are addressed to:

 * The IETF plenary session
 * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG

   or design team list, or any other list functioning under IETF auspices
 * Any IETF working group or portion thereof
 * Any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session
 * The IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB
 * The RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function

   (updated by [RFC 4879](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4879)).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function,
that are clearly not intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or
function, are not IETF Contributions in the context of this notice.

Please consult [RFC 5378](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and [RFC 
3979](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979) for details.
