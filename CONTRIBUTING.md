## Following Discussion

The Working Group has a few venues for discussion:

* We have a session at most [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/), and sometimes in between. See our [meeting materials repository](https://github.com/httpwg/wg-materials), and the [official proceedings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/meetings/) for details.

* Our [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/) is used for most communication, including notifications of meetings, new drafts, consensus calls and other business, as well as issue discussion.

* We also discuss specific issues on the [issues list](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues) itself. If you don't want to use Github to follow these discussions, you can subscribe to the [issue announce list](https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/http-issues).

To be active in the Working Group, you can participate in any of these places. Most activity takes
place on the mailing list, but if you just want to comment on and raise issues, that's fine too.


## Raising Issues

We use our [issues list](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues) to track items for
discussion and their resolution.

Before filing a new issue, please consider a few things:

* Issues should be just that; issues with our deliverables, **not questions or support requests**.

* Please review the issues list to make sure that you aren't filing a duplicate.

* If you're not sure how to phrase your issue, please ask on the [mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/).

Issues can also be raised on the [Working Group mailing
list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/) by clearly marking them as such (e.g., in
the `Subject:` line).

Be aware that issues might be rephrased, changed in scope, or combined with others, so that the
group can focus its efforts. If you feel that such a change loses an important part of your
original issue, please bring it up, either in comments or on the list.

Off-topic and duplicate issues will be closed without discussion. Note that comments on individual
commits will only be responded to with best effort, and may not be seen.


## Resolving Issues

Issues will be labeled by the Chairs as either `editorial` or `design`.

* **Design** issues require discussion and consensus in the Working Group. This discussion can happen both in the issue and on the [Working Group mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/), as outlined below. 

* **Editorial** issues can be closed by the editor(s) without consensus or notification. Typically, any discussion will take place on the issue itself.

Consensus for the resolution of a design issue can be established in a few different ways:

* Through discussion on the mailing list. Once a resolution is found, it will be recorded in the issue.

* Through discussion on the issues list. Once a resolution is found, it will be confirmed on the mailing list before consensus is declared. 

The editors can also propose resolutions for the group's consideration by incorporating them into
the draft(s); when doing so, the issue should not be closed until consensus is declared.

Issues that have consensus will be labelled as `editor-ready`. After the editor has incorporated a
resolution into the specification, the issue can be closed.

When a new draft is published, the design issues that have been closed since the last draft will be
highlighted on the mailing list, to aid reviewers. If substantive new information is brought to our
attention, issues can be reopened by the Chairs.


## Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests, both for editorial suggestions and to resolve open issues. In the latter
case, please identify the relevant issue.

Please do not use a pull request to open a new design issue.


## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies to all Working Group
communications and meetings.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) intended by the Contributor for publication as
